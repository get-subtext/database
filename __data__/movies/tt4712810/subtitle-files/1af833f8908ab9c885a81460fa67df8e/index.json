    "3816651 3821550 diamond, but you just went and made it<br />deeply personal.",
    "3821750 3827750 And now, I am really looking forward to<br />taking you down.",
    "3828710 3830090 My father would have loved you.",
    "3831020 3832350 He was quite fond of magic.",
    "3832910 3836630 When I was five or six, in one of the few<br />moments that I had him to myself,",
    "3837760 3838760 he taught me a trick.",
    "3839220 3843230 He would make a red silk handkerchief<br />disappear and then come back out of his mouth.",
    "3843410 3844590 I loved it.",
    "3845340 3846860 It had just the right amount of flair.",
    "3847815 3850010 And I practiced that trick for months.",
    "3850860 3857411 I thought that if I could do just<br />right, I would earn more of... of him.",
    "3859185 3860250 But that was the illusion.",
    "3861530 3862930 I've hated magic ever since.",
    "3863950 3865030 The camp, the cheese.",
    "3865870 3870230 Not to say anything of con artists like<br />you with your mentalism.",
    "3872830 3875530 Neither one of us has psychic powers,<br />Mr. McKinney.",
    "3876770 3877770 And you don't have to.",
    "3878430 3879670 You know where my heart is.",
    "3880060 3883190 And I don't have to, because you're going<br />to tell me.",
    "3884885 3887198 I think you're smart<br />enough to know that I",
    "3887199 3890651 ain't telling you shit,<br />as we say in Texas.",
    "3890830 3893010 And you're wrong about mentalism.",
    "3893190 3896990 People wear their entire life story on<br />their face.",
    "3898120 3899950 You just have to know how to read it.",
    "3900710 3902350 Take yours, for example.",
    "3904050 3904210 May I?",
    "3904830 3905830 With pleasure.",
    "3907780 3908830 This is going to be fun.",
    "3910310 3915950 Well, you've already shared an<br />excruciating detail, your daddy issues,",
    "3916440 3919190 but I'm curious about your mom.",
    "3920970 3923810 Why did she commit suicide?",
    "3925620 3931370 Was she as desperate for your father's<br />attention as you were?",
    "3933770 3935030 Oh, she was.",
    "3935850 3937770 And why was that?",
    "3938430 3941710 Did your father give his attention to<br />someone else?",
    "3944060 3947450 When you tuck your hair behind your ear,<br />that's a tell.",
    "3949130 3950130 He was.",
    "3952025 3954750 So, was he banging his secretary?",
    "3955110 3956970 No, that's too cliche.",
    "3957790 3961090 But it had to be someone close to your mom<br />for her too.",
    "3962690 3963410 A good friend?",
    "3963411 3965530 A hairdresser?",
    "3968210 3970050 It wasn't the housekeeper, was it?",
    "3971350 3973650 No, not the housekeeper.",
    "3974390 3975990 I don't have time for this.",
    "3976610 3979270 And that's what people usually say when<br />I'm getting hot.",
    "3979450 3982030 Should we crank up the AC, maybe open a<br />window?",
    "3982630 3990110 Now, if my dad was having sex with my<br />housekeeper and my mom found out and",
    "3990111 3996950 committed suicide, I probably wouldn't cut<br />the brakes on my housekeeper's car.",
    "3997290 4000610 But then again, I'm not a psychopath.",
    "4002900 4005490 You are a sad and pathetic man.",
    "4006910 4009210 I can see why you want to end it.",
    "4010180 4016950 Hey, Veronica, you know, walking away is<br />also a tell.",
    "4024300 4025300 Jeff!",
