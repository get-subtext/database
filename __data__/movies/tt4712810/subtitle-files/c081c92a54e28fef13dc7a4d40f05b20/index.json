    "4412200 4415820 They're introducing a new car this weekend<br />in Abu Dhabi.",
    "4416300 4418220 So we can get merit back and expose her.",

    "4474780 4478600 Before I discovered the horseman,<br />I didn't give a shit about anything.",
    "4479420 4480880 My family gave me up.",
    "4481740 4482920 I hated the whole world.",
    "4484440 4491961 And then I saw a video of you guys and you<br />were trying to make the world less corrupt.",
    "4493520 4494520 Less terrible.",
    "4495955 4499700 And that made me give a shit.",
    "4507010 4508770 So what's the trick?",
    "4512270 4513690 I promise this is going to work.",
    "4513910 4515190 But is that enough misdirection?",
    "4516170 4517470 As long as she's here.",
    "4517710 4518710 I'm not there.",
    "4519070 4519750 We can take care of that.",

    "4529870 4530290 This is nuts.",
    "4530470 4531050 There's too many variables.",
    "4531350 4533750 Hey, we'll be in constant contact with you<br />if something goes awry.",
    "4533770 4536390 Yeah, there's like no margin for error<br />here, man.",
    "4536470 4537190 Okay, zero.",
