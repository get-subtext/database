    "10500 13202 I'm Alex Garland, writer.",
    "16820 20339 (Danny) I don't know<br />whether Fox ever noticed this,",
    "20340 23099 but we shifted the timing of the music",
    "23100 28124 on this opening credit sequence<br />on their logo.",
    "32140 35730 (Alex) This is stuff we mocked up.",
    "37300 40699 (Danny) When we first started this,",
    "40700 44259 Alex wrote all these<br />images for the beginning,",
    "44260 49059 a lot of which were based on<br />Sorious Samura's footage from Sierra Leone.",
    "49060 52859 We debated at one point<br />about using real footage",
    "52860 57379 of terrible civil unrest<br />and death and violence.",
    "57380 62939 We decided, rightly, I think, that we wouldn't<br />use anything that involved any real deaths.",
    "62940 68499 The footage that is in there that does<br />involve deaths, like the necklace thing,",
    "68500 71099 it was all mocked up.",
    "71100 75099 - (Alex) In London.<br />- (Danny) On a very nice day in Docklands.",
    "75100 78019 We tried to make it look like<br />real footage from the past.",
    "78020 81219 We shot the film on DV<br />and the news footage at the beginning",
    "81220 86050 helps you into the slight<br />different quality of the visuals.",
    "87740 92459 This is Johnny,<br />who's a chimp from Stuttgart",
    "92460 95979 which is where we had to go<br />to film this sequence.",
    "95980 99939 There are only two working troupes<br />of chimps for use in the film industry.",
    "99940 102499 One's in Los Angeles and<br />one's in Stuttgart.",
    "102500 105739 It's a kind of family circus.<br />Amazing people.",
    "105740 111002 They were very kind to us<br />when we shot there over three or four days.",
    "115740 119019 We did debate having<br />different nationalities.",
    "119020 121539 For instance,<br />we were gonna make them German.",
    "121540 125899 At one point we were gonna make<br />them Scandinavian. Then Japanese.",
    "125900 129219 Even at point,<br />we thought of making them American.",
    "129220 134847 (Alex) But the quarantine idea<br />eventually locked them down to the UK.",
    "136860 142579 This was really where we were gonna try<br />and get as much exposition as we needed",
    "142580 146250 out of the way in this opening sequence.",
    "148140 151339 I suppose we've got<br />a little bit dropped in later,",
    "151340 157659 but we had this idea which was to set<br />the premise up as quickly as possible,",
    "157660 161045 And then return to it<br />as little as possible.",
    "162140 164779 (Danny)<br />It looks very distressing for the chimps,",
    "164780 170008 the cages that they're in<br />and the bed that he's lying on.",
    "172220 176739 But we were guided completely,",
    "176740 179979 and took in what we were allowed<br />to do and the sizes of the cages,",
    "179980 183579 by the guy who looks after the chimps.",
    "183580 189684 He breeds them. He brings them up from birth<br />and keeps them until they're in their 405.",
    "190340 194259 Interestingly, one reason there are<br />so few working chimps any more",
    "194260 199779 is that because of recent legislation, they're<br />not allowed to put down chimps any more.",
    "199780 203139 You can only work them<br />until they're seven or eight years old",
    "203140 205219 and they live to about 40 or 50.",
    "205220 209419 But for the last 20 or 30 years of their<br />life they're very difficult to work with.",
    "209420 214842 This man works with them right through.<br />And they adore him. They were wonderful.",
    "217140 221447 This is the setup, as<br />Alex was talking about.",
    "221940 226779 When I first read this scene, I thought<br />what a wonderful premise it was for a film,",
    "226780 229859 this idea of a psychological virus.",
    "229860 233339 We've all seen movies<br />with viruses escaping,",
    "233340 236699 but they're usually some kind<br />of biological or chemical agent.",
    "236700 241979 But the idea - which is fantasy, which is a<br />slight sci-fi premise - of a psychological virus",
    "241980 248210 I just think is a brilliant original idea and<br />a fantastic premise to start the film on.",
    "258460 260939 (Alex) This sequence is interesting for me",
    "260940 268859 because I think this scene more than any other<br />is pure genre in the way that it's written.",
    "268860 273179 But in the way that it's shot<br />and the way that Danny executed it,",
    "273180 276486 it pulls it away from that.",
    "278660 282059 It was quite strange for me<br />watching this for the first time",
    "282060 288419 because I had to get used<br />to that different approach.",
    "288420 292859 With the rest of the film, it was supposed<br />to be moving away from genre,",
    "292860 297979 but this felt almost like a set piece.",
    "297980 301684 But the execution of it,<br />I think, is terrific.",
    "312300 315401 (Danny) It's always useful to remember<br />the very first time you read a script.",
    "316340 321299 That's the last time you're as close in<br />experience to the audience's, seeing it fresh.",
    "321300 325139 This was the thing that stuck in my mind,<br />the use of the title - as a subtitle.",
    "325140 328419 There was no title.<br />I thought that was brilliant. I love that.",
    "328420 332059 So we were determined<br />not to have any names up front.",
    "332060 334219 (Alex) That's our Tootsie cut.",
    "334220 336059 <i>(laughter)</i>",
    "336060 338979 In Tootsie Dustin Hoffman realises,",
    "338980 341979 in order to make it as an actor,<br />he has to dress as a woman.",
    "341980 346059 Then you just cut to him walking<br />down the street as a woman.",
    "346060 350059 You never show him dressing up.<br />I think they show that later.",
    "350060 353969 That's what we did here.<br />We tried to cut to the chase.",
    "355340 359139 (Danny) But we put him<br />in green pyjamas instead.",
    "359140 362047 (Alex) Or no pyjamas.",
    "362860 367406 (Danny) There are two types<br />of hospitals in Britain.",
    "368500 370579 There's the more Victorian type.",
    "370580 374659 Then there's the modern type,<br />usually associated with private healthcare.",
    "374660 377739 But this is a National Health<br />hospital in Acton.",
    "377740 382659 It's a day hospital, for day operations.<br />It had a wonderful modern quality about it.",
    "382660 389419 We always try to emphasise<br />the modern in British life.",
    "389420 393819 It's just a choice,<br />rather than looking backwards.",
    "393820 399179 It has a feeling about it almost of<br />a hotel, somehow, a modern hotel,",
    "399180 402979 especially in the wider shots coming up.",
    "402980 406019 Cillian was very worried<br />about doing these scenes naked.",
    "406020 408779 We had the usual closed set.",
    "408780 414691 Nobody was allowed to make any jokes<br />all day in case they were misinterpreted.",
    "425060 429699 We made a big choice about<br />whether there were gonna be bodies.",
    "429700 433339 Indeed we did shoot some bodies<br />in this opening sequence,",
    "433340 438019 but we decided to follow<br />one of our instincts which was that,",
    "438020 440979 rather than trying to litter<br />the world with corpses,",
    "440980 443979 we were better to make it almost symbolic.",
    "443980 448499 The emptiness of the place stood for<br />something that had gone wrong",
    "448500 454001 rather than specific reality of corpses<br />lying around and blood everywhere.",
    "455380 460179 (Alex) Atmosphere and surrealism<br />over plot requirements.",
    "460180 464771 It's like an aesthetic decision.",
    "465500 471179 But it's something we've been picked up on.<br />\"Why aren't there more bodies around?\"",
    "471180 475099 There's not really a good logical reason<br />for it in storytelling terms,",
    "475100 478739 it's just because it<br />feels more interesting.",
    "478740 482444 Hopefully, that's a legitimate reason.",
    "489660 496139 (Danny) My life, since I've become<br />involved in making films,",
    "496140 498659 has centred around two questions so far.",
    "498660 502979 One was \"How did you get Ewan McGregor to<br />come out of the toilet in Trainspotting?\"",
    "502980 506699 The second was \"What was it like<br />to work with Leonardo DiCaprio?\"",
    "506700 509659 I'm grateful that both of them<br />have been replaced by",
    "509660 513699 \"How did you shoot<br />the London scenes on this one?\"",
    "513700 517059 The answer is<br />in the most obvious way you'd expect.",
    "517060 521499 We managed somehow to close the streets down,<br />albeit only for brief moments of time.",
    "521500 524819 We used multicameras - the digital cameras.",
    "524820 527739 We filmed for maybe<br />90 seconds or two minutes",
    "527740 531979 where the traffic was held back by these<br />wonderful traffic marshals that we used,",
    "531980 534419 who were students and friends.",
    "534420 536499 My daughter Grace was one of them.",
    "536500 540299 Holding back the traffic<br />at different times.",
    "540300 546099 And we managed to get this footage<br />that is a great advert for the film.",
    "546100 553139 It's one of things that's helped us sell the<br />premise of the film enthrallingly, I hope.",
    "553140 558419 (Alex) I think, somewhere around here,<br />there's one of our deliberate mistakes.",
    "558420 562059 I've always imagined that<br />there's a car moving in the background.",
    "562060 565939 It's not here. Where is it?<br />It's along the Embankment.",
    "565940 570499 - (Danny) Alex is convinced there's a car.<br />- (Alex) It was while you were talking.",
    "570500 573659 We think he's just trying<br />to undermine the film. (laughs)",
    "573660 575619 <i>(coughing)</i>",
    "575620 580099 - I've got a terrible cold. Sorry about that.<br />- (Alex) He's had a big weekend.",
    "580100 583739 You wouldn't be allowed to do this.<br />We did this before September 11th.",
    "583740 585819 To put a bus on its side in Whitehall,",
    "585820 589339 outside Downing Street<br />where the prime minister's residence is,",
    "589340 591419 you wouldn't be allowed to now.",
    "591420 596259 We only just got away with it, helped by the<br />inventiveness of Mark Tildesley, the designer,",
    "596260 600099 who swore blind to them that he could<br />get it in and out of there in 15 minutes.",
    "600100 604659 And he proved himself right. I think they<br />were surprised that we kept to our word.",
    "604660 607819 We said to these places<br />\"We'll go in and we'll shoot",
    "607820 611179 and we'll be out of there<br />by 7.30 or <i>8</i> o'clock in the morning.\"",
    "611180 614219 They're used to the bullshit<br />that film people are full of,",
    "614220 616859 where they end up taking<br />18 hours to shoot it.",
    "616860 619259 But each day we kept to our word.",
    "619260 623219 This stuff is based on<br />a photograph out of Cambodia,",
    "623220 626924 after Pol Pot was driven out of Phnom Penh.",
    "629060 632979 There was money all in the streets<br />because it was useless.",
    "632980 638179 There's various references like that<br />that we had,",
    "638180 644059 which just gave us a visual image<br />to add to details of the story",
    "644060 647570 as he makes his way through the city.",
    "684780 687699 This is a very busy part of London -<br />Tottenham Court Road.",
    "687700 692849 And Centre Point, the famous empty<br />building. Or partially empty now.",
    "694500 698419 We didn't use music at<br />first in this sequence",
    "698420 703379 and that moment, with the alarm going off,<br />used to give you a heart attack",
    "703380 705859 if you didn't have some background music.",
    "705860 708619 We used this track from<br />Godspeed You! Black Emperor,",
    "708620 712059 French Canadian anarchists<br />who allowed us to use their music,",
    "712060 714619 this driving, apocalyptic, climactic music",
    "714620 717779 which I think is<br />a wonderful addition to the film.",
    "717780 722099 (Alex) This is this image that became...",
    "722100 726259 Prescient is not the right word<br />because it's after the fact,",
    "726260 729579 but this was shot pre-September 11th.",
    "729580 731979 What was it from? Was it Peking?",
    "731980 734579 (Danny) It was an earthquake<br />in China years ago,",
    "734580 737739 where they'd done the same thing<br />of trying to contact each other",
    "737740 741444 when normal communication breaks down.",
    "743780 749139 But we came up with the idea<br />because there were billboards around Eros,",
    "749140 751219 the statue in Piccadilly Circus.",
    "751220 753299 We thought \"How can we use that?\"",
    "753300 758019 If you're flowing,<br />something good comes out of things.",
    "758020 760882 Good ides come out of problems.",
    "765700 772339 I have to thank the girl who spent<br />three months writing up all those notices.",
    "772340 774699 We did a lot of filming in East London.",
    "774700 780339 This is a church in... not in Spitalfields,<br />in Limehouse in East London.",
    "780340 783499 It's one of the famous Hawksmoor churches.",
    "783500 788139 There are seven of them, which are<br />supposedly in the shape of a pentangle.",
    "788140 789779 (Alex) Something like that.",
    "789780 792939 (Danny) Some Satanic thing.<br />Don't know whether it's true.",
    "792940 799647 (Alex) If you read From Hell by Alan Moore, he<br />goes into a lot of detail about those churches.",
    "800300 805939 (Danny) This was fun, telling the church<br />warden what we were gonna write on his wall.",
    "805940 808419 But we were honest<br />and he gave us permission.",
    "808420 813011 You can just about read it,<br />which is how we wanted it to look.",
    "813380 816659 What we were saying earlier<br />about the bodies in the street,",
    "816660 818899 when you decide on that and clear them out,",
    "818900 824819 we came up with this idea<br />that we'd put all the bodies in a church.",
    "824820 828019 That was sort of influenced<br />by stories that we'd heard",
    "828020 833979 about Rwanda and places like that,<br />with corpses ending up in churches.",
    "833980 837099 We thought it'd just be<br />a dumping house for corpses,",
    "837100 842249 some kind of mortuary<br />or makeshift cemetery for the corpses.",
    "843020 848859 It felt like the film was evolving then,<br />out of the circumstances,",
    "848860 853339 and that he was understanding<br />as he went along in the way that we are.",
    "853340 857442 He knows nothing<br />like we know virtually nothing.",
    "880660 885459 All those corpses that you see in the church<br />are actually volunteers who turned up for us.",
    "885460 888099 I think we gave them a free cup<br />of tea or something.",
    "888100 891819 A generous offering for them to come<br />for a few hours. They were students.",
    "891820 896539 We couldn't afford to hire extras in the<br />conventional way. We didn't have the money.",
    "896540 899139 They were people who just<br />turned up and helped us.",
    "899140 901739 The man who played the priest<br />was an enormous help.",
    "901740 904579 He did lots of workshops<br />with us about movement.",
    "904580 908363 He's a brilliant movement artist.",
    "908700 913007 I did all these different states,<br />showing the actors...",
    "913100 916339 I haven't got time to go into it here,<br />but he was an enormous help",
    "916340 921139 in developing the physical movement of the<br />Infected, which he starts off there -",
    "921140 927099 and is an erratic, frenetic,<br />violent, impatient gesture,",
    "927100 930007 a bit like the feeling of rage, really.",
    "931300 937370 (Alex) This was the day everyone wanted to be<br />on set, to see this petrol station blow up.",
    "939700 943659 200 grand. It was the most expensive<br />single thing we did, wasn't it?",
    "943660 948059 (Danny) Apart from your fee, Alex, yeah.<br />No, I'm only kidding.",
    "948060 951859 (Alex) Was I earning over 200 grand?<br />I'll have to bring that up.",
    "951860 955379 (Danny) Actually, I think<br />it cost L250,000 in total.",
    "955380 959339 It seems like, and is,<br />an enormous amount of money, obviously.",
    "959340 963819 But what we always feel is that when you put<br />the film out to be for a mainstream audience,",
    "963820 969699 they're not gonna say \"It's a British film,<br />we don't mind if the explosions aren't good.\"",
    "969700 973019 They want it to be as good<br />as a Mel Gibson film,",
    "973020 978219 as whatever's out there, that you're<br />competing with in the multiplex.",
    "978220 981619 So I think it's money well spent<br />and it's the end of our first reel,",
    "981620 985299 so there's an extraordinary sequence<br />which starts with London empty",
    "985300 988659 and builds to this incredible<br />explosion across it.",

    "5313100 5316739 We use these Canon XL1 cameras<br />and it has this frame setting",
    "5316740 5320299 which suggests that it shoots<br />not just at 24 frames a second,",

    "5326860 5333059 It isn't actually slowing the film down<br />when you look back at it,",

    "5338100 5341779 When you run it,<br />they appear slightly kind of jerky",
    "5341780 5347379 or not quite true in the way that you<br />normally watch films in the cinema.",
    "5347380 5353325 We used the technique whenever anybody was<br />infected. We used it for these Infected.",

    "5357900 5361139 when we wanted to give<br />the sense that he was infected.",

    "5375740 5378442 say it.",

    "5449700 5453739 Sometimes you think of them as directors,<br />but not in the way the cameraman does.",

    "5462060 5465570 You'll see when he crosses back now.",

    "5512580 5516299 Although the whole idea of this<br />isn't very nice at all.",
    "5516300 5520299 (Alex) This was a sort of gag,<br />this shot coming up.",
    "5520300 5524004 This left-to-right, like a tennis match.",
    "5525300 5530859 It's risky because if people laugh,<br />does that destroy the tension?",
    "5530860 5535326 And if they don't laugh,<br />have you failed to provide a gag?",
    "5538940 5543486 This had some cuts in<br />it on grounds of taste.",

    "5868700 5871779 (Alex) That's method acting.<br />You just go for it.",
    "5871780 5876379 (Danny) If you watch it<br />without sound, it's OK, really.",
    "5876380 5879979 It's the sound that makes it<br />so unbearable in a way.",
    "5879980 5885720 (Alex) Yeah, and his thumbs being<br />right in his sockets adds something.",
    "5890100 5894179 So here's where you have a problem.<br />You have a continuity issue.",

    "5951180 5954486 by gagging, really, I suppose.",
    "5957820 5962699 This is all very well manipulated<br />by everybody cos Megan can't drive,",

    "5966740 5973179 It's very cleverly put together by drivers and<br />people pushing the car with her ahold of it.",

    "5978220 5982899 (Alex) It's also the thing that led to<br />a lot of these multiple endings",
