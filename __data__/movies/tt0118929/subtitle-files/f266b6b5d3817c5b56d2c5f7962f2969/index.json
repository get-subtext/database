    "4938300 4943337 This business of you being a killer<br />was an unhappy coincidence.",
    "4943338 4946240 You have had dozens<br />of lives before now.",
    "4946241 4950344 You just happened to wake up while<br />I was imprinting you with this one.",
    "4950345 4952513 Why are they doing all of this?",

    "4978239 4982239 You resisted my attempt<br />to imprint you.",
    "4985714 4989149 Somehow you have developed<br />their ability to tune.",
    "4989150 4992052 That is how they change things.<br />That is how they built this city.",

    "5015310 5017878 and give us back new memories<br />of their choosing.",
    "5017879 5022519 But they still needed an artist<br />to help them.",

    "5031893 5033360 because they needed them.",
    "5033361 5037451 But they made me<br />delete everything else.",
