    "4260200 4262520 What if the first time we ever met...",
    "4262560 4266240 was last night in your--<br />in our apartment...",
    "4266280 4269080 and everything you remember...",
    "4269120 4271840 and everything that I'm supposed<br />to remember never really happened?",
    "4271880 4274360 Someone just wants us to think it did.",
    "4279320 4281600 You know, back in the apartment...",
    "4282360 4284680 I suddenly felt like<br />I didn't know you at all.",
    "4286400 4288800 It was as if you were a stranger.",
    "4291000 4292640 But how can that be true?",
    "4293240 4297200 I so vividly remember meeting you.",
    "4297240 4300160 I remember falling in love with you.",
    "4300960 4302680 I remember losing you.",

    "4306760 4308800 Please, just...",
    "4308840 4309920 just one more minute.",
    "4316160 4318200 I love you, John.",
    "4320920 4323520 You can't fake something like that.",
    "4324440 4325720 No, you can't.",

    "4357840 4360320 Detective Walenski<br />killed himself last night.",
    "4360360 4363960 I...kind of thought<br />you should know.",

    "4370160 4371280 Sir...",
    "4377120 4379040 I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.",

    "4407720 4408840 How can we help you, sir?",
    "4408880 4411160 You can sleep.",
    "4413200 4414160 Gentlemen--",
    "4414200 4415680 Sleep. Sleep.",
    "4419200 4420400 Evening, sir.",
    "4428920 4429920 Bumstead.",
    "4432680 4436120 I wanted to be the first<br />to congratulate you...about the case.",
    "4438720 4441400 Take us to Murdoch.",
    "4441440 4442480 Sleep.",
    "4468960 4470280 Dr. Schreber.",
    "4471400 4473120 I knew you'd come eventually.",
    "4473160 4475720 Don't you think it's about time<br />you started giving me some answers?",
    "4475760 4477880 Yes. Yes, of course.",
    "4477920 4479560 Won't you please sit down?",
    "4482560 4484480 I come here quite often.",
    "4484520 4486880 It's one of the few places<br />I'm allowed a moment's peace.",
    "4486920 4490160 You see,<br />they have an aversion to water.",
    "4491280 4493160 One could almost call it a phobia.",
    "4493680 4496800 Who are they?<br />What do they want from me?",
    "4496840 4498360 Right.",
    "4498400 4500360 Well, for now, let's just say...",
    "4500400 4503000 that you were the subject<br />of their experiment.",
    "4503040 4504360 We all are.",
    "4506560 4508400 You're not crazy, John.",
    "4509160 4510800 And you are not a murderer.",
    "4512680 4514360 I'm sorry about this. I truly am.",
    "4514400 4515840 But we do not have much time...",
    "4515880 4518400 and I cannot afford the luxury<br />of doing this the right way.",

    "4519960 4522200 all the answers<br />are in this syringe.",
    "4522240 4523360 I need you to inject yourself.",
    "4523400 4525720 It's the only way to<br />make you understand.",
    "4525760 4527000 You're kidding me, right?",
    "4527040 4529880 We're running out of time, John.<br />You have to do this now.",
    "4530440 4531840 Give me the gun, Doctor.",
    "4531880 4534240 Inspector, he is more<br />disturbed than we thought.",
    "4534280 4536880 I may not be the judge of personality<br />that you are, Doctor...",
    "4536920 4539760 but you're the one<br />who looks disturbed to me.",
    "4540640 4542360 You do not know<br />what you are doing.",
    "4543520 4546960 What, exactly is in this...Doctor?",
    "4548640 4550720 All the answers you've<br />been looking for, John.",
    "4550760 4551840 I swear to you.",
    "4553320 4558160 Guess I'll just have to<br />hold on to it for...safekeeping.",
    "4558200 4559360 If you don't mind.",
    "4559400 4560680 Let's go, Doctor.",
    "4561960 4567120 - Go? Where are we going?<br />- Shell Beach.",
    "4568120 4570400 That's where you want to go, isn't it?",
    "4570440 4571960 The ocean.",
    "4580640 4582080 Why are you doing this?",
    "4583720 4585280 What do you hope to gain by helping me?",
    "4585320 4586800 The truth.",
    "4587520 4590400 None of these maps extend far enough<br />to show the ocean.",
    "4590440 4591760 You won't find anything there...",
    "4591800 4593640 I promise you!<br />I've been there, and--",
    "4593680 4596120 If you've been there,<br />you can show us the way, then, can't you?",
    "4597200 4598720 We'll see for ourselves.",
    "4599720 4600720 I won't.",
    "4601840 4604480 I refuse.<br />You can't make me go there!",
    "4616200 4618280 You were saying, doctor?",
    "4629560 4632960 I don't understand.<br />Used to be a bridge here.",
    "4639400 4640920 Try that again,<br />your friends are gonna be...",
    "4641000 4642280 fishing you out of the canal.",
    "4642280 4643640 Just don't hurt me.<br />I'll tell you everything.",
    "4643680 4645600 It doesn't matter anymore anyway.",
    "4652280 4653400 What?",
    "4656040 4658240 Who are you people?",
    "4662240 4666560 We will give you some more<br />pretty things soon...Anna.",
    "4667000 4668160 I'm not Anna.",
    "4669920 4671760 You will be soon, yes.",
    "4675680 4678400 I have another use for her first.",
    "4684880 4689880 First there was darkness.<br />Then came the strangers.",
    "4691960 4694160 They abducted us<br />and brought us here.",
    "4695400 4698040 This city, everyone in it...",
    "4698080 4699400 is their experiment.",

    "4723640 4724640 even a lost wallet.",
    "4725200 4726800 Then they observe the results.",
    "4728200 4732120 Will a man, given the history<br />of a killer, continue in that vein?",
    "4732160 4735960 Or are we, in fact, more<br />than the mere sum of our memories?",
    "4736040 4740800 This business of you being a killer<br />was an unhappy coincidence.",
    "4740840 4743600 You have had dozens<br />of lives before now.",
    "4743640 4746840 You just happened to wake up<br />while I was imprinting you with this one.",
    "4747560 4749600 Why are they doing all of this?",
    "4749640 4752920 It is our capacity for individuality...",
    "4752960 4755400 our souls that makes<br />us different from them.",
    "4755440 4757720 They think they<br />can find the human soul...",
    "4757760 4760760 if they understand<br />how our memories work.",
    "4760800 4762000 All they have<br />are collective memories.",
    "4762040 4764760 They share one group mind.",
    "4764800 4766200 They're dying, you see?",
    "4766240 4769520 Their entire race<br />is on the brink of extinction.",
    "4769560 4771360 They think we can save them.",
    "4771400 4773720 - Where do I fit in?<br />- You are different, John.",
    "4774320 4777040 You resisted my attempt<br />to imprint you.",
    "4781480 4784760 Somehow you have developed<br />their ability to tune.",
    "4784800 4786040 That is how they change things.",
    "4786080 4787520 That is how they built this city.",
    "4787560 4790360 They have machines buried deep<br />beneath the surface...",
    "4790400 4794160 that allow them<br />to focus their telepathic energies.",
    "4795000 4797400 They control everything here,<br />even the sun.",
    "4797440 4800640 That's why it's always dark.<br />They can't stand the light.",
    "4800680 4801880 So why do they need you?",
    "4801920 4806120 When they first brought us here,<br />they extracted what was in us.",
    "4806160 4809840 So they could store the information,<br />remix it like so much paint...",
    "4809880 4812280 and give us back new memories<br />of their choosing.",
    "4812320 4815800 But they still needed an artist<br />to help them.",
    "4817600 4820640 I understood the intricacies<br />of the human mind...",
    "4820680 4823080 better than they ever could...",
    "4823120 4825760 so they allowed me<br />to keep my skills as a scientist...",
    "4825800 4827160 because they needed them.",
    "4827200 4829560 But they made me<br />delete everything else.",

    "4865440 4867240 You say they brought us here.",
    "4868960 4870080 From where?",
    "4873760 4874720 I'm sorry.",
    "4875840 4877520 I don't remember.",
