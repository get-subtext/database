    "2082760 2083840 It wasn't just your dream.",
    "2085400 2086620 It was my premonition.",
    "2088220 2091880 Years ago, at the sky view, I got a<br />glimpse into the future.",
    "2092960 2094840 And saw what death was about to do.",
    "2105120 2106120 Oh,",

    "2120880 2121880 This isn't right.",
    "2122560 2123560 Is that a no?",
    "2125320 2126440 Everyone's going to die.",
    "2127340 2129200 The whole building is going to come down.",
    "2129480 2130480 Are you serious?",
    "2132360 2133360 The penny.",
    "2133680 2133980 Iris?",
    "2134200 2134520 Keep up.",
    "2134940 2135820 What the hell, lady?",
    "2135821 2136836 You need to give it to me.",
    "2136860 2137860 What are you doing?",
    "2138460 2140240 What the fuck is wrong with you?",
    "2144670 2145670 Iris?",
    "2145790 2147290 She knows you'll make me a bummer.",
    "2177780 2180540 I saved a lot of lives that night.",
    "2181940 2183540 Lives that were never meant to be saved.",
    "2185260 2186780 They closed the restaurant after that.",
    "2187970 2190780 Said it needed additional renovations.",
    "2192300 2193300 But it never reopened.",
    "2194260 2195440 Eventually they tore it down.",
    "2196260 2198140 So you stopped the disaster?",
    "2199420 2200420 Yes.",
    "2204420 2206800 But death doesn't like it when you fuck<br />with his plans.",
    "2207500 2211100 So over the years he came back and he<br />killed everyone who was there that night.",
    "2212050 2213050 Including my Paul.",
    "2216180 2216740 Wait, wait a minute.",
    "2216780 2219540 I'm sorry, did you did you say death came<br />back?",
    "2220060 2221600 He's a relentless son of a bitch.",
    "2222500 2224220 Won't stop till he finishes the job.",
    "2224360 2226640 But I taught myself how to see him coming.",
    "2227360 2229340 To anticipate his every move.",
    "2229780 2232280 Been keeping him at bay for years now.",
    "2234370 2235370 Now he's got me.",
    "2235640 2236640 Cancer.",
    "2237200 2238340 Believe that shit?",
    "2238980 2239480 Sorry.",
    "2239840 2241300 Got the diagnosis two months ago.",
    "2242340 2244240 Wait, that's when I started having my<br />dream.",
    "2244720 2245720 See, it's a sign.",
    "2246360 2248800 Okay, but why am I dreaming about what you<br />saw?",
    "2249340 2251480 Maybe my cancer passed my premonition on<br />to you.",
    "2251600 2254080 Maybe it's fate's demented sense of humor.",
    "2254180 2255180 Who the hell knows?",
    "2255340 2259760 What matters is that when the universe<br />speaks, you pay attention.",
    "2272010 2273470 I see you, you fuck.",
    "2277470 2281690 Um, who are you talking to?",
    "2282210 2283210 Death.",
    "2283550 2285450 He thinks I'm distracted because you're<br />here.",
    "2286810 2288790 I have to teach you everything in this<br />book.",
    "2289190 2291370 It'll take some time to learn the basics.",
    "2291830 2293010 So you need to stay here.",
    "2293190 2293710 Stay here?",
    "2293790 2295190 Yes, high world is too dangerous.",
    "2295350 2297270 I haven't stepped out there in 20 years.",
    "2297271 2299350 In here, we can be safe.",
    "2301090 2302090 Oh.",
    "2302590 2303590 See that?",
    "2303790 2304790 Yeah.",
    "2304850 2306070 This is all my research.",
    "2306770 2307770 My life's work.",
    "2308510 2309510 Look, I'm sorry.",
    "2309630 2311550 I can't stay here.",
    "2311670 2313530 I have to get back to school.",
    "2313870 2315770 But you know, I'll come back and I'll<br />visit.",
    "2316010 2317290 No, I'm sick.",
    "2317450 2318810 I won't be alive that long.",
    "2318910 2319910 You can't leave.",
    "2320470 2321470 Don't you see?",
    "2322190 2324190 Death is coming for our family.",
    "2325450 2326450 Oh.",
    "2327450 2328810 You don't believe me?",
    "2329510 2329690 No.",
    "2330050 2333050 I think I made a mistake.",
    "2333550 2336110 I think it was probably just a dream.",
    "2336310 2337310 No, wait!",
    "2337370 2338470 At least take the book!",
    "2339090 2340090 Stephanie!",
    "2340810 2341810 Stephanie!",
    "2367570 2368770 Look, I'm sorry.",
    "2368910 2369990 I shouldn't have found you.",
    "2370630 2372570 This book is a lifeline.",
    "2372970 2375690 It will show you everything you need to<br />know to keep our family safe.",
    "2377130 2379210 You still don't believe me?",
    "2383530 2384530 Step back.",
    "2385050 2386050 Why?",
    "2388090 2389310 Seeing is believing.",
    "2411180 2412180 Hey, Steph.",
    "2412720 2414216 Her face really exploded right in front of<br />you.",
    "2414240 2416520 Is that like-Just leave her alone.",
    "2417560 2418480 It's my bad, Steph.",
    "2418560 2419560 I'm just curious.",

    "2430300 2432200 I never should have went there.",
    "2432460 2433900 Honey, there's no need to apologize.",
    "2434820 2437400 I'm so sorry you had to go through that.",
    "2441520 2443360 She said something to me before she died.",

    "2484860 2485860 Come on.",
    "2491440 2492960 You think she'll come to the barbecue?",
    "2496330 2496570 Steph?",
    "2497070 2499510 Hey, if she's going to Uncle Howard's<br />house, then I'm not.",
    "2499511 2500730 You can get a ride with Dad.",

    "2528780 2529600 You used to be best friends.",
    "2529720 2530580 You don't even talk anymore.",
    "2530581 2532200 Okay, well, I'm sorry.",
    "2533220 2536860 I've just been distracted the last couple<br />of months because of this nightmare.",
    "2537120 2537600 What about before that?",
    "2537680 2539280 It's been like this ever since you left.",
    "2540700 2543280 You're mad at Mom, but you haven't been<br />around either.",
    "2543440 2545900 I'm not like her, okay?",
    "2547400 2548680 I'm not crazy.",
    "2551860 2552860 Yeah, you're right.",
    "2553620 2554620 You're not crazy.",
    "2556040 2557040 You just don't care.",
    "2642520 2644000 Now you got it.",
    "2644120 2645120 Watch out for splinters.",
    "2659480 2661160 Hey, there she is.",

    "3184570 3186310 No, it has everything to do with us.",

    "3192110 3193830 Families that they never should have had.",

    "3227370 3228370 Go fuck yourself.",

    "3244810 3246310 This is so messed up.",

    "3766710 3768230 Gonna move on its own, Steph?",
    "3768290 3769370 Is that what it's gonna do?",
    "3770050 3771050 It could fall.",

    "3774370 3775370 I'll take my chances.",
    "3775970 3778870 Steph, how is a couple kids with a soccer<br />ball gonna kill him?",
    "3779910 3781530 I mean, I don't know.",
    "3782250 3787150 The trimmer could fall and hit the leaf<br />blower guy, which causes him to...",
    "3787170 3790610 blow stuff into the kid's eyes and then<br />take the ball to his face.",
    "3790810 3792170 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",
    "3793390 3794570 Soccer ball to my face?",

    "4576220 4577220 Yes.",

    "4592480 4593876 Maybe we should let the guy finish.",
    "4593900 4597460 Then, to truly break the cycle,<br />you have to die.",
    "4598800 4599800 What does that mean?",
    "4601010 4604442 A long time ago, a young<br />woman named Kimberly",
    "4604443 4608800 Corman found herself on<br />death's list, just like you.",

    "4623600 4625580 Why didn't Iris try that?",
    "4625860 4626860 It's risky.",
    "4627280 4633360 And if you fuck with death and lose,<br />things can get very messy.",
    "4634300 4635300 Wait.",
    "4637110 4637570 Hang on.",
    "4637630 4637870 Hang on.",
    "4638010 4639010 Okay, wait.",
    "4639050 4640970 There has to be another way.",

    "4730730 4731170 Congratulations.",
    "4731171 4733070 Wait, there has to be something else,<br />right?",

    "4736490 4737490 No.",
