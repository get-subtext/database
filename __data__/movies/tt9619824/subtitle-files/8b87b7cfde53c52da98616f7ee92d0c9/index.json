    "1528900 1529920 She said yes.",
    "1530000 1530900 Oh my gosh.",
    "1532320 1533440 Who's Jenny?",
    "1535300 1536840 Oh, he met her in Junior Lifeguards.",
    "1537360 1538220 Junior Lifeguards?",

    "1580540 1581260 I was gonna make some lunch.",
    "1581660 1585220 No, actually, I came here because I wanted to talk to you about your mother.",
    "1586020 1586380 Iris.",
    "1586380 1588720 I know you don't like to talk about her.",
    "1588860 1589380 There's not much to tell.",
    "1589720 1590720 Hey, kids, come on, lunch!",
    "1591240 1595760 It's just that I've been having this recurring nightmare about her.",
    "1596140 1597720 Oh, honey, it's probably just a stress.",
    "1598020 1599300 You should try melatonin.",
    "1600080 1605420 Okay, but the weird thing is, I've been dreaming about a real place from 50 years ago.",
    "1605560 1607240 It was like a restaurant called The Skyview.",
    "1610750 1611570 You know what it is?",
    "1612550 1613750 Did Iris tell you about it?",
    "1614310 1615410 What did she say?",
    "1615410 1616730 Okay, did she say anything?",
    "1617210 1618490 Maybe if I could talk to her...",
    "1618490 1619090 Talk to who?",
    "1620070 1621530 Steph is dreaming about Grandma Iris.",
    "1622210 1622790 Psycho granny?",
    "1623050 1623990 I thought she was dead.",
    "1624150 1625650 Well, she's dead to us.",
    "1626450 1630010 Stephanie, Iris Campbell is a very deeply disturbed woman.",
    "1630630 1634170 Look, if I could just talk to her, then maybe I can get these dreams to stop.",
    "1634230 1635090 Steph, just drop it.",
    "1635710 1636170 I don't get it.",
    "1636190 1637650 What happened that was so bad?",
    "1637710 1639730 For one thing, she's the reason that your mother's so screwed up.",
    "1639930 1640170 What?",
    "1640170 1641910 Look, I just don't want to talk about this anymore, okay?",
    "1642070 1644130 Uncle Howard, please, I just need to know.",
    "1644910 1653690 Look, Stephanie, after our father died, Iris just snapped.",
    "1654930 1656630 She wouldn't let us go to school.",
    "1656930 1658470 She locked us inside the house.",
    "1659110 1662170 She obsessed about all the horrific ways we could die.",
    "1662970 1666718 And eventually it got so bad, I mean so bad,",
    "1666918 1670325 that the state came in and they took your mother and I away from her.",
    "1671110 1672130 But it didn't end there.",
    "1672210 1675384 She tracked us all through foster care, and when the kids were born,",
    "1675584 1678736 she started sending us these horrible letters,",
    "1678736 1682910 that were full of obituaries and these disturbing pictures of dead bodies.",
    "1683090 1685350 We had to move so she couldn't contact us anymore.",
    "1687030 1692450 So, uh, do you still have any of those letters?",
    "1692890 1692990 No.",
    "1695190 1695630 I...",
    "1695630 1699010 Stephanie, listen to me.",
    "1699870 1702890 That woman is a sick and dangerous person.",
    "1703810 1708250 And for your well-being and your safety, stay the hell away from her.",
    "1709230 1709970 I believe you.",
    "1714480 1715700 I found Paco!",
    "1717140 1720300 I'm sure he'd love to be in the living room right now.",
    "1720680 1722460 Come on, guys.",
    "1722460 1724680 How did he ever get in there?",
    "1725320 1726900 I need you to help me.",
    "1728200 1729520 You heard your uncle.",
    "1729700 1731060 Just let it go.",
    "1731340 1732280 Just let it go.",
    "1733740 1734680 You don't understand.",
    "1735320 1737520 My whole life is falling apart because of this dream.",
    "1738280 1741060 And not only that, I feel like I'm losing my mind.",
    "1741420 1743380 Please, you are the only person who can help me.",
    "1743700 1745960 Howard would never forgive me if I put you in touch with Iris.",
    "1747600 1748000 Please.",
    "1748000 1748100 Please.",
    "1754630 1760750 Whatever you do, do not look in the bottom drawer of the dining room cabinet.",
    "1858600 1862960 Hi, um, I'm here to see Iris Campbell.",
    "1863180 1864300 Did you not see the signs?",
    "1864960 1867320 Uh, uh, yeah, yes, I did.",
    "1867620 1870620 Then get the fuck out of here.",
    "1870880 1871640 I'm your granddaughter.",
    "1872860 1878040 Stephanie, empty your pockets.",
    "1878900 1880200 Phone, keys, everything.",
    "1880720 1881820 Well, I'm not dangerous.",
    "1883440 1884600 It's not you I'm afraid of.",
    "1886640 1887520 Uh.",
    "1963880 1964700 Come in slowly.",
    "1985350 1986650 Shut the door.",
    "1987090 1987650 Quick, quick, quick.",
    "1991050 1991890 Don't move.",
    "1999260 2000380 Oh my god.",
    "2002000 2003100 It really is you.",
    "2006180 2007600 I can see your mother in you.",
    "2010280 2011320 Hi, um.",
    "2011520 2012740 Stop, stop.",
    "2013000 2014680 Don't move.",
    "2015540 2016820 Not until I tell you.",
    "2019110 2020330 Trying to trick me, aren't you?",
    "2022510 2024010 Getting me to let my guard down.",
    "2025070 2025430 I.",
    "2026350 2027010 There you go.",
    "2027270 2027450 Run.",
    "2029830 2030510 Sit.",
    "2032030 2033330 Okay, um.",
    "2035760 2036260 That's it.",
    "2037820 2038500 So.",
    "2039800 2041080 How is Darlene?",
    "2041640 2042180 Your mom?",
    "2042320 2042620 Okay.",
    "2042840 2045400 Uh, no, I don't know.",
    "2045840 2048100 She left when I was ten.",
    "2048260 2050540 So we don't see her anymore.",
    "2051020 2051360 Oh.",
    "2055170 2056589 But you saw my letters.",
    "2056730 2057950 That's why you're here, right?",
    "2058690 2059089 No.",
    "2059089 2059769 Um.",
    "2061029 2064910 I'm actually here because I've been dreaming about the sky view.",
    "2066270 2066830 Yeah.",
    "2067370 2070930 Yeah, every single night for the past two months it's the same dream.",
    "2071570 2079350 In it, you're on a date but then the dance floor breaks and then there's an explosion and then you fall and die.",
    "2079530 2079690 Yeah.",
    "2080330 2081570 Yeah, everyone dies.",
    "2082790 2083850 It wasn't just your dream.",
    "2085150 2086610 It was my premonition.",
    "2087730 2095290 Years ago at the sky view I got a glimpse into the future and saw what death was about to do.",
    "2103360 2108420 Hey, don't throw that penny.",
    "2108760 2109520 You could kill somebody.",
    "2109800 2110680 Oh, I'm so sorry.",
    "2110820 2111280 Of course.",
    "2112660 2117740 These past two years have been absolutely magical and that's all because of you.",
    "2117740 2119020 No, no, no.",
    "2119240 2121800 This isn't right.",
    "2122540 2123560 Is that a no?",
    "2125260 2126440 Everyone's going to die.",
    "2127300 2129220 The whole building is going to come down.",
    "2129480 2130340 Are you serious?",
    "2132320 2133060 The penny.",
    "2133660 2133980 Iris?",
    "2134160 2136700 Give it to me.",
    "2136840 2137300 What are you doing?",
    "2138200 2140220 What the fuck is wrong with you?",
    "2144600 2145120 Iris?",
    "2178500 2180180 I saved a lot of lives that night.",
    "2182420 2183280 They were meant to be saved.",
    "2185200 2186720 They closed the restaurant after that.",
    "2187640 2191060 Said it needed additional renovations.",
    "2192040 2193360 But it never reopened.",
    "2194260 2195420 Eventually they tore it down.",
    "2195420 2198140 So you stopped the disaster?",
    "2199400 2199840 Yes.",
    "2204120 2206780 But death doesn't like it when you fuck with his plans.",
    "2207340 2211220 So over the years he came back and he killed everyone who was there that night.",
    "2211980 2213040 Including my Paul.",
    "2216110 2216730 Wait a minute.",
    "2216870 2217150 I'm sorry.",
    "2217230 2219550 Did you say death came back?",
    "2219910 2221590 He's a relentless son of a bitch.",
    "2222450 2224250 Won't stop till he finishes the job.",
    "2224310 2226670 But I taught myself how to see him coming.",
    "2227310 2229370 To anticipate his every move.",
    "2230090 2232470 Been keeping him at bay for years now.",
    "2234310 2235170 And now he's got me.",
    "2235550 2235890 Cancer.",
    "2236590 2236810 Oh.",
    "2237290 2238350 Believe that shit?",
    "2238990 2239430 Sorry.",
    "2239850 2241290 Got the diagnosis two months ago.",
    "2242150 2242670 Wait.",
    "2242790 2244270 That's when I started having my dream.",
    "2244670 2244910 See?",
    "2245130 2245750 It's a sign.",
    "2246290 2248830 Okay, but why am I dreaming about what you saw?",
    "2249330 2251490 Maybe my cancer passed my premonition on to you.",
    "2251570 2254090 Maybe it's fate's demented sense of humor.",
    "2254090 2254950 Who the hell knows?",
    "2255150 2259830 What matters is that when the universe speaks you pay attention.",
    "2272110 2273470 I see you, you fuck.",
    "2277090 2277610 Huh?",
    "2279030 2279550 Um.",
    "2280250 2281590 Who are you talking to?",
    "2282110 2282450 Death.",
    "2283490 2285330 He thinks I'm distracted because you're here.",
    "2286730 2288830 I have to teach you everything in this book.",
    "2289230 2291350 It'll take some time to learn the basics.",
    "2291890 2293010 So you'll need to stay here.",
    "2293010 2293730 Stay here?",
    "2293910 2295210 The outside world is too dangerous.",
    "2295350 2297290 I haven't stepped out there in twenty years.",
    "2297430 2299330 In here, we can be safe.",
    "2301890 2302370 Oh.",
    "2302370 2303090 See that?",
    "2303850 2304330 Yeah.",
    "2304890 2306110 This is all my research.",
    "2306690 2307450 My life's work.",
    "2308410 2309290 Look, I'm sorry.",
    "2309390 2310290 I can't.",
    "2310590 2311549 I can't stay here.",
    "2311690 2315789 I have to get back to school, but, you know, I'll come back and I'll visit.",
    "2316010 2316250 No!",
    "2316630 2317330 I'm sick!",
    "2317530 2318830 I won't be alive that long.",
    "2318909 2319990 You can't leave.",
    "2320409 2321169 Don't you see?",
    "2321169 2324250 Death is coming for our family.",
    "2326870 2328790 You don't believe me?",
    "2329470 2329670 No.",
    "2330090 2333070 I think I made a mistake.",
    "2333470 2336110 I think it was probably just a dream.",
    "2336270 2336870 No, wait!",
    "2337370 2338490 At least take the book!",
    "2370880 2372580 This book is a lifeline.",
    "2372900 2375580 It will show you everything you need to know to keep our family safe.",
    "2377040 2378980 You still don't believe me?",
    "2383500 2384500 Step back.",
    "2388060 2389300 Seeing is believing.",
    "2411120 2411920 Hey, Steph.",
    "2412400 2414140 Her face really exploded right in front of you.",
    "2414200 2414460 Hey!",
    "2415380 2416540 Just leave her alone.",
    "2417800 2418540 It's my bad, Steph.",
    "2418580 2419220 I'm just curious.",
    "2421350 2421610 Hey.",
    "2423150 2424210 How are you holding up?",
    "2426290 2427430 Sorry Uncle helped.",
    "2429090 2430170 You were right about ours.",
    "2430330 2432190 I never should have went there.",
    "2432430 2433730 Honey, there's no need to apologize.",
    "2434770 2437370 I'm so sorry you had to go through that.",
    "2441450 2443390 She said something to me before she died.",
    "2443470 2445150 She said death was coming for our family.",
    "2445430 2447330 That's crazy, right?",
    "2448530 2451660 I can't believe it.",
    "2451860 2452540 I emailed her.",
    "2452660 2453940 I just didn't think she'd show up.",
    "2456580 2457540 Come on.",
    "2464740 2467820 Is that Mom?",
    "2469780 2470060 Yeah.",
    "2476560 2476900 Really?",
    "2479380 2479860 Wow.",
    "2483600 2484600 Don't be ridiculous.",
    "2484920 2485460 Come on.",
    "2486240 2486780 Get down here.",
    "2486860 2487120 Come here.",
    "2491570 2492430 Welcome to the barbecue.",
    "2496210 2496610 Steph.",
    "2497110 2499570 If she's going to Uncle Howard's house, then I'm not.",
    "2499810 2500730 You can get a ride with Dad.",
    "2501490 2502690 You're not even going to talk to her?",
    "2503330 2503970 Come on.",
    "2504530 2505790 You don't remember her like I do.",
    "2506270 2507450 Just give her a chance.",
    "2507570 2507850 Why?",
    "2508470 2510990 Charlie, she abandoned us and now she rolls in here?",
    "2511530 2513570 After all these years and wants to act like nothing happened?",
    "2517470 2519150 Because who would do that, right?",
    "2519990 2520790 Wait, what?",
    "2520970 2521210 Nothing.",
    "2521530 2521790 No.",
    "2523630 2524770 What's that supposed to mean?",
    "2524770 2527570 I tried calling you so many times and nothing.",
    "2527990 2528650 Same with Julia.",
    "2528750 2529630 You used to be best friends.",
    "2529690 2530610 You don't even talk anymore.",
    "2530750 2531050 Okay.",
    "2531250 2532190 Well, I'm sorry.",
    "2533290 2536790 I've just been distracted the last couple of months because of this and this nightmare.",
    "2537050 2537610 What about before that?",
    "2537650 2539010 It's been like this ever since you left.",
    "2540710 2543270 You're mad at Mom, but you haven't been around either.",
    "2543470 2544330 I'm not like her.",
    "2545590 2545890 Okay?",
    "2547430 2548730 I'm not crazy.",
    "2552110 2552650 No, you're right.",
    "2553550 2554390 You're not crazy.",
    "2555030 2555510 Okay.",
    "2555510 2556890 You just don't care.",
    "2643180 2644820 Now you got it, watch out for splinters.",
    "2659560 2661080 Hey, there she is.",
    "2662020 2662340 Hey.",
    "2663480 2664180 Come here.",

    "2673160 2673620 Come on over.",
    "2675280 2676340 I made cookies.",
    "2676640 2677120 That's great.",
    "2678020 2679040 Can I try one?",
    "2679360 2680060 Yes, of course.",
    "2686180 2687260 Does this have peanut butter?",
    "2688000 2688300 Yeah.",
    "2691770 2693210 Are you trying to kill my brother?",
    "2694010 2694770 Oh, my God.",
    "2694850 2695310 Bob is allergic.",
    "2695690 2695990 Yeah.",
    "2696410 2697350 I totally forgot.",
    "2697470 2698190 I'm so sorry.",
    "2698230 2699250 The important thing is that you're here.",
    "2699530 2701110 So, Bobby Bartender, drinks.",
    "2701210 2701990 Drinks all around.",
    "2711100 2711540 Family.",
    "2712780 2714700 You don't get to pick the one you get.",
    "2714700 2718120 You just got to love the one that you got.",
    "2719820 2724620 Now, our mother, she lived alone until the day that she died.",
    "2725580 2730082 And her death should be a reminder to all of us to enjoy life,",
    "2730082 2736320 and spend the time that we have together because we're not going to get any back.",
    "2737940 2739040 I love you guys.",
    "2740800 2741340 Cheers.",
    "2742120 2742660 Cheers.",
    "2742660 2742900 Cheers.",
    "2743540 2743720 Cheers.",
    "2755680 2758640 Oh, my God.",
    "2758680 2759880 There's a bug in there.",
    "2759880 2761840 Oh, my God.",
    "2787400 2788273 I got it.",
    "2788473 2790413 - I think, you got it.<br />- Just watch.",
    "2794144 2797617 - I'm trying to get a new job.<br />- That's great!",
    "2797870 2798490 Charlie!",
    "2799170 2800250 Get up here.",
    "2841220 2841920 Do you want me to join you?",
    "2842420 2843099 Good to see you.",
    "2849920 2851340 The setup you've got here.",
    "2851820 2857380 Well, I wanted the kids to have a happy childhood unlike some people I know.",
    "2858000 2859580 You're not talking about us, are you?",
    "2859760 2860020 Oh, no.",
    "2860200 2861080 We had a great childhood.",
    "2862080 2862660 Look at me.",
    "2862700 2865060 I turned out fabulous.",
    "2869120 2869560 Yep.",
    "2874510 2874950 Howard.",
    "2876030 2877230 What is that?",
    "2877430 2879110 It looks like a house key.",
    "2880310 2880870 Come on.",
    "2880870 2882538 You know, we got the spare room,",
    "2882738 2885163 and it's got to be better than bouncing around trailer parks.",
    "2892970 2894470 I don't think this is a good idea.",
    "2894630 2896410 It's never too late for a second chance.",
    "2900690 2901310 I'm sorry.",
    "2905370 2906550 They're better off without me.",
    "2910470 2910990 Pick up.",
    "2911050 2911350 Pick up.",
    "2911430 2911730 Come on.",
    "2914110 2915110 You got to me, all right?",
    "2915330 2916350 You got to me.",
    "2929810 2932250 Hey, guys, come show us your back flip.",
    "2932270 2932390 What?",
    "2932590 2933150 No, no, no.",
    "2933390 2934610 Yeah, come on, Uncle Howard.",
    "2934810 2935610 Come on, Howard.",
    "2942830 2943230 Howard.",
    "2943230 2946620 Oh, yeah.",
    "2946720 2947320 There you go.",
    "2952280 2953680 All right, here we go.",
    "2953780 2954160 Watch out.",
    "2954160 2955240 Wait, stop!",
    "2966200 2967120 Nice catch, Andy.",
    "2968020 2969560 Alright, here we go.",
    "2970380 2972540 Come on, Howard.",
    "2972820 2973220 Here we go.",
    "2977240 2978420 Careful, Howard!",
    "3010080 3010680 Stephanie.",
    "3012240 3013580 I'm glad you decided to come.",
    "3016620 3018720 Now the whole family's here!",
    "3022200 3023720 I'm okay.",
    "3024600 3024940 Alright.",
    "3025340 3026100 Good.",
    "3053600 3056720 And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.",
    "3115550 3116610 What is all this stuff?",
    "3122640 3123060 Okay.",
    "3124260 3126300 I found these papers in Iris' book.",
    "3126940 3132101 They are obituaries and articles for the people who were at the Skyview,",
    "3132301 3134479 on the night that Iris had her premonition.",
    "3135660 3139700 Each one of these people went on to die in some weird and messed up way.",
    "3139800 3143800 And not only that, they all died in the same order as Iris' premonition.",
    "3144540 3149200 Hundreds of people were supposed to die that night, but Iris stopped the disaster.",
    "3150880 3153540 So, death came back for them one by one.",
    "3154620 3158820 Since there were so many survivors, it took years for death to get to all of them.",
    "3159220 3160740 But eventually it got to Iris.",
    "3162720 3164420 I mean, she was the last to die in the premonition.",
    "3165280 3167200 It was her and a little boy.",
    "3169000 3170120 But she was prepared.",
    "3171700 3175300 She single-handedly held off death for decades.",
    "3175560 3176480 Stephanie, sweetie.",
    "3177960 3180360 I don't think this is the appropriate time for this.",
    "3180660 3183140 Yeah, I mean, none of this even has anything to do with us, right?",
    "3183140 3184560 Why are we even here?",
    "3184600 3186320 It has everything to do with us.",
    "3187060 3191720 Because death took so long to make its way through the survivors, these people went on to have families.",
    "3191960 3193780 Families that they never should have had.",
    "3194820 3196240 So death took them too.",
    "3198900 3200020 Don't you see this?",
    "3201240 3204280 Death is coming for us because we were never supposed to exist.",
    "3205400 3209240 Okay, so why everybody in this room is on death's hit list?",
    "3209380 3211300 Bobby, Doc, that's what she's saying.",
    "3211300 3212400 No, no, no.",
    "3212500 3215280 Dad and Aunt Brenda are safe because they're not part of Iris' bloodline.",
    "3215800 3216200 Okay.",
    "3217040 3221940 Following the pattern, death makes its way down each branch by age.",
    "3222320 3227260 So because Uncle Howard was the oldest, it'll start with his family first, meaning Eric, you're next.",
    "3227380 3228200 Go fuck yourself.",
    "3228480 3230900 Then it'll go for Julia, then Bobby.",
    "3232100 3237440 Then it'll come for our branch, starting with Darlene, then me, then Charlie.",
    "3238740 3239220 Charlie.",
    "3241300 3241960 You buying this?",
    "3243560 3244140 I don't know.",
    "3244740 3246140 This is so messed up.",
    "3246540 3249860 I mean, you're turning our dad's death into some kind of fucked up conspiracy theory.",
    "3250140 3251060 What is wrong with you?",
    "3251120 3251940 No, no, no, no, no.",
    "3252060 3254060 It's not, it's not a conspiracy theory.",
    "3254380 3254920 That's enough.",
    "3255040 3255820 We're all gonna die.",
    "3255840 3256060 Stop!",
    "3256480 3258540 I can't listen to this for one more minute.",
    "3259100 3264060 That crazy woman's nonsense has caused enough pain and suffering for this family.",
    "3264320 3264600 Hang on.",
    "3265560 3267300 Aunt Brenda, please just leave it alone.",
    "3267480 3271380 Okay, in Iris' book, she mentions somebody who cheated death and survived.",
    "3271380 3271840 Stephanie.",
    "3273000 3273920 Eric, no, wait.",
    "3274380 3275500 I'm worried about you.",
    "3275700 3276420 Stop it.",
    "3278020 3279240 I'll be taking care of this.",
    "3279400 3279900 Come on, Bobby.",
    "3279980 3280260 Brenda.",
    "3280480 3280760 Let's go.",
    "3281120 3282180 No, no, no, you can't.",
    "3282180 3282480 I'm sorry.",
    "3282780 3283160 Please.",
    "3283940 3285080 You believe me, right?",
    "3285500 3286380 I'm sorry.",
    "3286560 3286800 Julia.",
    "3287180 3288240 Look, I love you.",
    "3290320 3291840 But sometimes I really hate you.",
    "3291840 3292340 I know.",
    "3312460 3318700 I know how convincing all of this can be, but it's not real.",
    "3319540 3320860 How can you say that?",
    "3321360 3323120 I know Iris taught you all of this.",
    "3324100 3328920 Don't let my mom's beliefs derail your life the same way they did mine.",
    "3332830 3337330 Thank you so much for that advice, but I really don't need a mom anymore.",
    "3343120 3343800 All right, open wide.",
    "3344540 3345500 Very good.",
    "3347800 3349100 Just gonna pinch hard.",
    "3349280 3349480 Ready?",
    "3350140 3355500 Five, four, three, two.",
    "3357660 3358340 Good job.",
    "3360560 3361780 I'm gonna hit the club.",
    "3362220 3363120 I need you to lock up.",
    "3363640 3365000 And don't touch any of my liquor.",
    "3365160 3367260 No, no, you didn't say anything about locking up.",
    "3367260 3368000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
    "3368000 3369580 I didn't say shit about closing, dude.",
    "3369660 3370580 And cry me a river.",
    "3371460 3372740 I hope you burn in hell.",
    "3375360 3376520 You believe that shit?",
    "3377080 3378780 My old man just died.",
    "3378860 3382300 I come in as a favor to that asshole, and now he wants me to lock up.",
    "3383060 3384060 You know what that is?",
    "3386260 3387140 It's inconsiderate.",
    "3387800 3388920 Anyway, you're all done.",
    "3389840 3390500 Thank you.",
    "3390840 3392120 Hey, five-star review, yeah?",
    "3392680 3396160 Like and subscribe and all the things.",
    "3480560 3490350 No, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving, but",
    "3490350 3495310 I guess that's just the way the story goes.",
    "3496890 3506430 And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know.",
    "3508450 3514770 I can't live, if living is without you.",
    "3515650 3519910 I can't give.",
    "3519910 3523306 I can't give anymore.",
    "3562200 3563937 God dammit.",
    "3657399 3659182 Charlie, wake up.",
    "3659540 3660800 I've been trying to call Eric all night.",
    "3660940 3662000 He's not answering me.",
    "3662040 3662880 I don't know where he is.",
    "3663280 3663940 I'm worried.",
    "3664400 3665540 I'm sure he's fine.",
    "3665920 3667100 Well, have you heard from him?",
    "3674180 3675240 I'm going over there.",
    "3675300 3676220 I need to check on him.",
    "3677800 3679080 You're coming too, Charlie.",
    "3682200 3683380 I think he's gone to voicemail.",
    "3685970 3686530 Is that him?",
    "3687730 3690230 My friend just set the test recorder to burn down last night.",
    "3690730 3690910 What?",
    "3692030 3692750 Steph, Steph!",
    "3694930 3695350 Ow!",
    "3698380 3698640 Eric?",
    "3699800 3701280 Oh, yeah, no, of course it's you.",
    "3705910 3706330 Dude!",
    "3707410 3708290 We heard about the fire.",
    "3708410 3708950 We thought you were dead.",
    "3709010 3709830 I'm fine.",
    "3711010 3711730 Are you okay?",
    "3711750 3712590 I'm so worried about you.",
    "3712690 3713190 Yeah, fuck.",
    "3713250 3715790 Fire said I was lucky as fuck that I was wearing that leather jacket.",
    "3716150 3716890 Barely got burned.",
    "3717990 3719190 Really my favorite jacket, though.",
    "3719370 3719970 What is this?",
    "3720230 3721070 Oh, yeah, check it out.",
    "3722230 3723090 I got branded.",
    "3723990 3724570 Sick, right?",
    "3725370 3725850 You like it?",
    "3726290 3727330 You said you were asleep.",
    "3727590 3729590 You're blowing up my phone like a goddamn stalker.",
    "3729630 3730110 What do you want me to do?",
    "3730110 3731070 No, I don't get it.",
    "3731070 3731630 You should be dead.",
    "3732590 3734710 Right, yeah, yeah.",
    "3734890 3736810 Or, you know, maybe...",
    "3737410 3739730 Maybe death's not actually coming for our family.",
    "3740290 3742070 Because that would be fucking crazy.",
    "3743930 3744970 Jesus shit!",
    "3749160 3750160 Or maybe I'm invincible.",
    "3751920 3752440 Eric?",
    "3753320 3753840 Eric!",
    "3754580 3754960 Yeah?",
    "3755100 3755660 Eric, wait.",
    "3755940 3756320 Stop.",
    "3756420 3757120 Just wait, okay?",
    "3757620 3760040 Just because death didn't kill you last night doesn't mean that you're safe.",
    "3762060 3763460 Stay away from that tree trimmer!",
    "3764300 3764680 Ooh.",
    "3765420 3765800 Ooh.",
    "3766680 3768280 Gonna move on its own, Steph?",
    "3768300 3769240 Is that what it's gonna do?",
    "3770040 3770860 It could fall.",
    "3772000 3773160 And stay away from these kids.",
    "3774180 3775220 I'll take my chances.",
    "3776040 3778880 Steph, how's a couple kids with a soccer ball gonna kill him?",
    "3779920 3781560 I mean, I don't know.",
    "3781620 3785429 The trimmer could fall and hit the leaf blower guy,",
    "3785629 3790571 which causes him to blow stuff into the kids' eyes and then take the ball into his face.",
    "3790771 3791800 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",

    "3802710 3803310 What's up?",

    "3806830 3808550 Kiki, that was pretty bad.",
    "3808990 3810290 Oh, wait, let me see that.",
    "3810670 3812190 Eric, just stay away from the truck.",
    "3813450 3814010 Oh, what?",
    "3814070 3814470 This truck?",

    "3917450 3917550 Whoa!",
    "3956240 3957420 Should've believed you, Steph.",

    "3964310 3966390 I screwed up the order, and now Julia's dead.",
    "3966590 3967490 It's my fault.",
    "3970560 3973640 What happened was traumatic and awful.",

    "3978210 3979410 It's my fault.",
    "3980590 3981590 Well, it's not your fault.",
    "3981710 3982870 It is my fault.",
    "3983470 3989530 Stephanie, you were only wrong about the order, because there's something you shouldn't know.",
    "3995040 3997860 Eric isn't Howard's biological son.",
    "4001270 4002670 I'm sorry, what are you talking about?",

    "4008670 4010190 Well, I don't understand why you had an affair.",
    "4011350 4013930 You and your father and I were having such a hard time.",
    "4014550 4016630 But it was good, because I got you.",
    "4016890 4017670 I got you out of it.",
    "4017690 4018730 I was gonna read that, but I'm just gonna read that.",
    "4018730 4022290 It doesn't matter, because Howard loved you so, so much.",
    "4022310 4022750 Who is it?",
    "4025030 4026030 Who's been around all that?",
    "4029830 4030790 Gerard Fenbury.",

    "4036230 4037570 Oh, shit.",
    "4037970 4038590 No, no, no, no!",
    "4038990 4040490 Gerard fucking Fenbury?",
    "4040710 4042330 You don't know what we're going through.",
    "4043010 4043590 Oh, God.",
    "4043670 4045730 What, is this why you always wanted to play catch?",

    "4053110 4053590 Okay.",
    "4055190 4062030 So, that means that if it's going in the right order, then I'm next, right?",
    "4068620 4069980 You gotta help me, Steph.",
    "4071740 4074480 I don't think that I can.",
    "4074680 4076580 I mean, I thought I did, but I don't...",
    "4076580 4078980 No, but you can.",
    "4080360 4082960 I mean, you predicted exactly what was gonna happen.",
    "4084660 4087580 You just got the order wrong, because you didn't have all the information, Charlie.",
    "4087580 4089160 What do you mean, predicted?",
    "4090040 4091980 She saw everything.",
    "4092340 4095500 The trimmer, the blower, the soccer ball, like...",
    "4095500 4099880 It was like there were pieces to a puzzle, and she just had to put them together, you know what I mean?",
    "4100040 4100560 Is that true?",
    "4100740 4103880 Darling, please, do not encourage this.",
    "4103920 4105580 Marty, I mean...",
    "4107200 4109760 I mean, it's everything in Iris' book, it's...",
    "4109760 4112860 It's like, it's like an equation, it's math.",
    "4113059 4117380 Stephanie, if you can see how all of this fits together, we might have a chance.",
    "4117380 4124820 Steph, you devastated this family when you walked out, but we've been okay without you.",
    "4125360 4128360 I'm begging you not to traumatize our kids anymore.",
    "4129180 4130600 It's real this time.",
    "4135820 4136900 I'm going for a walk.",
    "4144500 4150691 I can appreciate that our family is clearly gonna need some counseling in the future, but...",
    "4150891 4154350 can we focus on the fact that we're all about to die, right?",
    "4154580 4155660 I mean...",
    "4156430 4163020 I mean, Steph, didn't you say that Iris knew someone that cheated death or something?",
    "4163180 4164580 Yeah, um...",
    "4165460 4168580 Right here, somewhere, it says...",
    "4170600 4171680 That, um...",
    "4171680 4172180 Right here.",
    "4172780 4178100 J.B. found someone who survived, but it doesn't say anything about who this J.B. was or...",
    "4178100 4179160 Wait a minute, I know that name.",
    "4179740 4181672 My mom used to write me letters,",
    "4181872 4187139 and she sometimes would talk about a friend of hers named J.B. who worked at a hospital.",
    "4189220 4189700 Um...",
    "4189700 4197880 Um, something, uh, something river hospital, uh, uh, deep river, uh, peace river hospital, uh, clear...",
    "4197880 4198860 Hope, Hope River?",
    "4199280 4199740 That's it!",
    "4200660 4201880 Shit, it's like an hour away.",
    "4202380 4202900 I'm going.",
    "4203460 4205000 I'm gonna go find him and talk to him myself.",
    "4205540 4206380 Well, I'm coming with you.",
    "4206380 4208820 That's it, okay, yeah, yeah, let's, let's go.",
    "4211480 4212280 Ozzy, I...",
    "4212280 4212980 What?",
    "4214000 4215920 You need to stay here with your mom and save her.",
    "4216740 4218820 Yeah, fuck that, are you kidding me?",
    "4218820 4220140 I'm not staying here by myself.",
    "4220560 4222760 It's too dangerous on the road for you, you can't...",
    "4222760 4226020 No, I read Gammy's death book, okay, alright?",
    "4226340 4230260 I mean, there's like a thousand house-related deaths in that thing, man.",
    "4230380 4233600 You trip down the stairs, fall...",
    "4233600 4236960 down a toilet or something, I don't, I don't know, but I'm not, I'm not...",
    "4236960 4238220 No way, I'm not staying here.",
    "4239780 4240440 Hang on, hang on.",
    "4240540 4242960 Hey, okay, too fast.",
    "4243100 4244420 Okay, okay, we'll go slow, we'll go slow.",
    "4244480 4245580 I'm gonna go open up the truck.",
    "4245660 4246580 Charlie, check the back.",
    "4246680 4246980 Got it.",
    "4252660 4254400 Be careful, the steps are slippery sometimes.",
    "4255340 4255660 Oi!",
    "4258000 4259720 Any of you fuckers doing nut check?",
    "4260840 4261440 Excuse me?",
    "4261440 4265480 You made cookies in that thing with peanut butter in them just a few days ago.",
    "4266300 4270580 This poor bastard so much as even touches a nut, his throat is gonna close up tight and...",
    "4271740 4273340 You understand, where's the peanut butter?",
    "4274140 4275220 Cabin and about the sink.",
    "4275580 4276100 Thank you.",
    "4277400 4279440 I'm so sorry, Bobby, I just...",
    "4282280 4283180 Hey, okay.",
    "4286540 4287220 All clear.",
    "4287920 4288480 Thank you.",
    "4289120 4290240 You're a good brother, Eric.",
    "4291480 4292020 Nut check.",
    "4292200 4292380 What?",
    "4292380 4293240 Oh!",
    "4293960 4294520 God!",
    "4296040 4296380 Oh!",
    "4297500 4299320 It was good, I get it.",
    "4299380 4300420 Come on.",
    "4300780 4302080 It's only getting worse.",
    "4303020 4303580 Dammit.",
    "4303960 4304320 Wait!",
    "4304940 4306280 I'm coming with you, bro.",
    "4307320 4308740 Someone's gotta protect you.",
    "4316400 4317820 Dad's calling, again?",
    "4318820 4320260 Tell him we just went for a ride with Mom.",
    "4320460 4321600 He's not gonna believe that.",
    "4321600 4323100 At least it'll buy us some time.",
    "4324080 4324340 Time?",
    "4327200 4328640 Death doesn't get us your dead will.",
    "4341290 4343130 I always keep them where I can see them.",
    "4345840 4349780 I mean, you could've just had the real thing, but it's okay, not everyone wants to be a mom.",
    "4352700 4353580 Is that what you think?",
    "4354600 4355820 That I don't wanna be a mom?",
    "4358820 4363720 Look, I was raised by a woman who taught me to see death everywhere.",
    "4364800 4368707 I thought I could put it behind me, but then when I had you and your brother,",
    "4368907 4373257 all I could see were a hundred different ways that you and Charlie could die.",
    "4374100 4375700 I didn't want you to leave the house.",
    "4376500 4378720 I would freak out on you guys over nothing.",
    "4380980 4386072 One day, I looked at your face, and I saw the same scared little girl that I was growing up,",
    "4386272 4388976 and I knew that if I stayed, I was gonna ruin your life.",
    "4391400 4393260 I have no idea if I did the right thing.",
    "4394760 4396500 But I'm here for you now.",
    "4437140 4438860 The front desk is this way.",
    "4445870 4449250 Hi, um, we're looking for JB.",
    "4450350 4451250 And who are you?",
    "4452270 4455010 The front desk told us we could find him down here, is that you?",
    "4466580 4468280 William John Bloodworth.",
    "4469080 4471060 But my friends call me JB.",
    "4471700 4474100 I've been waiting for you, Stephanie.",
    "4474800 4475460 Charlie.",
    "4480680 4482760 So, which one of you...",
    "4488680 4490500 I was sorry to hear about Iris.",
    "4491700 4493160 She was a special woman.",
    "4494320 4495360 How did you know her?",
    "4496360 4498020 She saved my life.",
    "4498640 4498980 When?",
    "4502450 4503530 The sky view.",
    "4504930 4511190 I went to work that night.",
    "4511190 4514850 JB, honey, I told you, you gotta stay back there while I'm on stage.",
    "4515150 4516930 I wasn't supposed to be there.",
    "4517070 4519010 Except, of course, to die.",
    "4548250 4554050 So all that time, she wasn't just protecting our family, she was protecting you too.",
    "4555350 4557370 Years later, she tracked me down.",
    "4558030 4559430 Helped me see the truth.",
    "4560330 4561670 We traded ideas.",
    "4562270 4564030 I helped her fortify her cabin.",
    "4564030 4566230 We became friends.",
    "4566630 4572090 I even helped her get the best medical care I could, considering her condition.",
    "4572630 4575730 Iris said that you'd found somebody who stopped death and survived.",
    "4576210 4576730 Yes.",
    "4577890 4579990 And how do we do that?",
    "4580150 4581930 There are only two ways.",
    "4582550 4584790 By killing, or by dying.",
    "4585670 4589510 If you take a life, you get the time that person had left.",
    "4589690 4590010 What?",
    "4590130 4592290 No, I'm not gonna kill someone.",
    "4592290 4593810 Maybe we should let the guy finish.",
    "4594130 4597550 Then to truly break the cycle, you have to die.",
    "4598310 4599610 What does that mean?",
    "4601030 4608770 A long time ago, a young woman named Kimberly Corman found herself on death's list, just like you.",
    "4609430 4612590 And when her turn finally came, she died.",
    "4613330 4613930 Flatlined.",
    "4614390 4619190 But her doctor managed to bring her back, and that broke the chain.",
    "4619690 4620850 Well, alright then, we'll do that.",
    "4620850 4622210 What are you talking about?",
    "4623510 4625589 Why didn't Iris try that?",
    "4625950 4626650 It's risky.",
    "4627230 4632849 And if you fuck with death and lose, things can get very messy.",
    "4636900 4637900 Hang on, hang on.",
    "4637980 4638380 Okay, wait.",
    "4639560 4640940 There has to be another way.",
    "4641440 4642619 Please, you have to help us.",
    "4643099 4645740 For years, people have been coming to me for advice.",
    "4647220 4648540 Well, I'm tired.",
    "4649060 4650460 I'm done with all that.",
    "4650460 4652900 And now I'm sick, just like Iris.",
    "4653020 4654920 There's no running this time.",
    "4655680 4658500 Fact is, you're all gonna die.",
    "4659320 4662160 And after that, I will too.",
    "4666060 4669090 Now that my old friend is gone, I'm retiring.",
    "4669390 4669990 So what?",
    "4670090 4671230 You're just gonna leave us here?",
    "4671590 4677110 I intend to enjoy the time I have left.",
    "4677770 4680690 And I suggest you do the same.",
    "4680690 4682750 Life is precious.",
    "4684430 4686850 Enjoy every single second.",
    "4688030 4689270 You never know when.",
    "4702100 4703140 That's fantastic.",
    "4704480 4704780 No.",
    "4705800 4707880 No, that can't be it.",
    "4708080 4708180 No.",
    "4708520 4711720 There has to be something here.",
    "4711800 4713360 There has to be another answer.",
    "4714660 4716980 He gave us an answer.",
    "4718120 4718840 Bobby's gotta die.",
    "4719480 4719880 Eric!",
    "4720580 4721880 Are you fucking insane?",
    "4721960 4722760 We're not killing Bobby.",
    "4722900 4725140 Am I the only guy that just listened to that dude?",
    "4725560 4726600 There's only one way.",
    "4726700 4727340 We kill Bobby.",
    "4727600 4730660 We resuscitate him, and then boom, you're all off death's list.",
    "4730760 4731160 Congratulations.",
    "4731580 4733060 There has to be something else, right?",
    "4733140 4735340 I mean, there has to be another solution, right, Steph?",
    "4736660 4736900 No.",
    "4738340 4740620 No, there's nothing else we can do.",
    "4740760 4741540 Okay, it's over.",
    "4743020 4747100 Hey, you gotta trust me on this, okay?",
    "4747400 4748480 She's giving up on you.",
    "4748640 4749540 I'm not going to.",
    "4749540 4752760 Look, Iris found a way to hold death off for decades.",
    "4755660 4756520 So will we.",
    "4756700 4757620 I trust that guy.",
    "4757900 4758760 Do you trust that guy?",
    "4758900 4759760 He was awesome.",
    "4760240 4761000 He was awesome.",
    "4761140 4762640 He was charismatic, and you know that as well.",
    "4777230 4778750 Eric and Bobby are gone.",
    "4780410 4780850 Shit.",
    "4780850 4781290 Shit!",

    "5375970 5377530 Yeah, and then she got her face blown off.",
    "5377530 5379430 She only died because she left the cabin.",
    "5380650 5384110 Outside is dangerous, but inside is the safest place that there is.",
    "5388480 5390840 It's the only place where we have any advantage.",

    "5408720 5412280 If anybody's gonna live in that cabin, it's me.",
    "5412660 5416560 And as long as I am alive, death can't touch you.",
    "5417180 5418220 Mom, let me do this.",
    "5418340 5420000 He'll never let you get there on your own.",
    "5420760 5422000 But I can see him coming.",
    "5423200 5424740 We have to do this together.",
    "5432900 5433240 You better.",
