    "2929480 2931190 I do feel like shit. Okay?",
    "2931270 2935520 - Hey, you introduced me to that prick Gant.<br />- I introduced him to Faith, too.",
    "2935610 2939650 Questionable move, definitely,<br />given the historical perspective.",
    "2939740 2941950 The way I had it figured,<br />I can take his money -",
    "2942040 2946400 you wouldn't believe what I'm charging - and<br />make sure Faith is okay at the same time.",
    "2946500 2949110 Keep an eye on her,<br />for you, okay?",
    "2949210 2953290 Which you can't do without getting<br />your fingers bent the wrong way back. See?",
