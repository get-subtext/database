00:49:27,270\nCome on, Uncle Howard.\n\n936\n00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,970\nHere we go.\n\n937\n00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:28,710\nJust like college.\n\n938\n00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:29,690\nThat was nice.\n\n939\n00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,050\nCareful, Howard.\n\n940\n00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,520\nI better get it out of there.\n\n941\n00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,820\nHey, Stephanie.\n\n942\n00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,600\nYou made it.\n\n943\n00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,000\nStephanie.\n\n944\n00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,780\nI'm glad you decided to come.\n\n945\n00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,760\nNow the whole family's here.\n\n946\n00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,220\nYeah.\n\n947\n00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:17,780\nI'm okay.\n\n948\n00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,080\nI'm all right.\n\n949\n00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,220\nOh, good.\n\n950\n00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,000\nI'm okay.\n\n951\n00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,360\nIt's okay.\n\n952\n00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,180\nIt's all right.\n\n953\n00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,040\nOh, God!\n\n954\n00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:43,630\nThe former things are passed away.\n\n955\n00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,690\nNeither shall there be mourning nor pain, and\n\n956\n00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,950\nhe shall wipe away every tear from their\n\n957\n00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,090\neyes, and death shall be no more.\n\n958\n00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,630\nHey.\n\n959\n00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:49,530\nWhere's all this stuff?\n\n960\n00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,100\nI found these papers in Iris' book.\n\n961\n00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,240\nThey are obituaries and articles for the people\n\n962\n00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,700\nwho were at the Skyview on the night\n\n963\n00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,000\nthat Iris had her premonition.\n\n964\n00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,720\nEach one of these people went on to\n\n965\n00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,340\ndie in some weird and messed up way,\n\n966\n00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,580\nand not only that, they all died in\n\n967\n00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,340\nthe same order as Iris' premonition.\n\n968\n00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,320\nHundreds of people were supposed to die that\n\n969\n00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,740\nnight, but Iris stopped the disaster.\n\n970\n00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,720\nSo death came back for them one by\n\n971\n00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:25,980\none.\n\n972\n00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,080\nSince there were so many survivors, it took\n\n973\n00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,040\nyears for death to get to all of\n\n974\n00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,060\nthem, but eventually it got to Iris.\n\n975\n00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,320\nShe was the last to die in the\n\n976\n00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,760\npremonition.\n\n977\n00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,640\nIt was her and a little boy, but\n\n978\n00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,400\nshe was prepared.\n\n979\n00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,520\nShe single-handedly held off death for decades.\n\n980\n00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,320\nStephanie, sweetie, I don't think this is the\n\n981\n00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,500\nappropriate time for this.\n\n982\n00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,840\nYeah, I mean, none of this even has\n\n983\n00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,220\nanything to do with us, right?\n\n984\n00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,500\nWhy are we even here?\n\n985\n00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:56,940\nNo, that's it.\n\n986\n00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,360\nIt has everything to do with us.\n\n987\n00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,860\nI mean, because death took so long to\n\n988\n00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,680\nmake its way through the survivors, these people\n\n989\n00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,880\nwent on to have families, families that they\n\n990\n00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,780\nnever should have had.\n\n991\n00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,160\nSo death took them too.\n\n992\n00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,960\nDon't you see this?\n\n993\n00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,720\nDeath is coming for us because we were\n\n994\n00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,100\nnever supposed to exist.\n\n995\n00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,760\nOkay, so why everybody in this room is\n\n996\n00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,000\non death's hit list?\n\n997\n00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,020\nBobby, Stock, that's what she's saying.\n\n998\n00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,120\nNo, no, no.\n\n999\n00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,760\nDad and Aunt Brenda are safe because they're\n\n1000\n00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,900\nnot part of Iris' bloodline.\n\n1001\n00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,060\nOkay, following the pattern, death makes its way\n\n1002\n00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,540\ndown each branch by age.\n\n1003\n00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,240\nSo because Uncle Howard was the oldest, it'll\n\n1004\n00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,460\nstart with his family first, meaning Eric, you're\n\n1005\n00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,800\nnext.\n\n1006\n00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,760\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n1007\n00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,380\nThen it'll go for Julia, then Bobby.\n\n1008\n00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,380\nThen it'll come for our branch, starting with\n\n1009\n00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,840\nDarlene, then me, then Charlie.\n\n1010\n00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,280\nCharlie, you buying this?\n\n1011\n00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,440\nI don't know.\n\n1012\n00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,440\nThis is so messed up.\n\n1013\n00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,240\nI mean, you're turning our dad's death into\n\n1014\n00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,100\nsome kind of fucked-up conspiracy theory.\n\n1015\n00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,240\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\n1016\n00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,200\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n1017\n00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,320\nIt's not, it's not a conspiracy theory.\n\n1018\n00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,240\nFab, enough.\n\n1019\n00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:06,960\nWe're all gonna die.\n\n1020\n00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,280\nStop.\n\n1021\n00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,400\nI can't listen to this for one more\n\n1022\n00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:09,820\nminute.\n\n1023\n00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,820\nThat crazy woman's nonsense has caused enough pain\n\n1024\n00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,140\nand suffering for this family.\n\n1025\n00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,680\nHang on.\n\n1026\n00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,880\nAunt Brenda, please, just listen.\n\n1027\n00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,340\nLeave me alone.\n\n1028\n00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,780\nOkay, in Iris' book, she mentions somebody who\n\n1029\n00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,340\ncheated death and survived.\n\n1030\n00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:22,740\nStephanie.\n\n1031\n00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,220\nCome on.\n\n1032\n00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,840\nEric, no, wait.\n\n1033\n00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,420\nI'm worried about you.\n\n1034\n00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,320\nStop it.\n\n1035\n00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,100\nLet me take care of this.\n\n1036\n00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,740\nCome

convincing all of this can\n\n1047\n00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:06,880\nbe.\n\n1048\n00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,060\nBut it's not real.\n\n1049\n00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,200\nHow can you say that?\n\n1050\n00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,440\nI know Iris taught you all of this.\n\n1051\n00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,120\nDon't let my mom's beliefs derail your life\n\n1052\n00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,220\nthe same way they did mine.\n\n1053\n00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,070\nThank you so much for that advice, but\n\n1054\n00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,550\nI really don't need a mom

I've\n\n1469\n01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,620\nbeen waiting for you, Stephanie.\n\n1470\n01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,060\nCharlie.\n\n1471\n01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,200\nDarlene.\n\n1472\n01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,920\nBut no Howard.\n\n1473\n01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:31,940\nNo Julia.\n\n1474\n01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,100\nSo, which one of you is next?\n\n1475\n01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:41,200\nI...\n\n1476\n01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,150\nI was sorry to hear about Iris.\n\n1477\n01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:45,890\nShe was a special woman.\n\n1478\n01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,110\nHow did you know her?\n\n1479\n01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,810\nShe saved my life.\n\n1480\n01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,070\nWhen?\n\n1481\n01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,330\nAt the Skyview.\n\n1482\n01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,520\nMy mother brought me with her to work\n\n1483\n01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,180\nthat night.\n\n1484\n01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,120\nJ.B., honey, I told you, you gotta\n\n1485\n01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,880\nstay back there while I'm on stage.\n\n1486\n01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,940\nI wasn't supposed to be there.\n\n1487\n01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,080\nExcept, of course, to die.\n\n1488\n01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,360\nStop playing!\n\n1489\n01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,560\nStop playing!\n\n1490\n01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,720\nEveryone needs to get off the dance floor!\n\n1491\n01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,560\nThe class is about to break!\n\n1492\n01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,060\nEveryone needs to get off now!\n\n1493\n01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:24,360\nWait!\n\n1494\n01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:25,860\nIris!\n\n1495\n01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,760\nYou were the last to die.\n\n1496\n01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,660\nYou were the little boy.\n\n1497\n01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,160\nCorrect.\n\n1498\n01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,000\nSo all that time, she wasn't...\n\n1499\n01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,220\nShe wasn't just protecting our family.\n\n1500\n01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,560\nShe was protecting you, too.\n\n1501\n01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,940\nYears later, she tracked me down.\n\n1502\n01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,080\nHelped me see the truth.\n\n1503\n01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,320\nWe traded ideas.\n\n1504\n01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,720\nI helped her fortify her cabin.\n\n1505\n01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,660\nWe became friends.\n\n1506\n01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,240\nI even helped her get the best medical\n\n1507\n01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,860\ncare I could, considering her condition.\n\n1508\n01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,740\nIris said that you found somebody who stopped\n\n1509\n01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,540\ndeath and survived.\n\n1510\n01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,220\nYes.\n\n1511\n01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,880\nAnd how do we do that?\n\n1512\n01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,860\nThere are only two ways.\n\n1513\n01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,700\nBy killing or by dying.\n\n1514\n01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,760\nIf you take a life, you get the\n\n1515\n01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,540\ntime that person had left.\n\n1516\n01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:24,000\nWhat?\n\n1517\n01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,420\nNo.\n\n1518\n01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,320\nI'm not gonna kill someone.\n\n1519\n01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,860\nMaybe we should let the guy finish.\n\n1520\n01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,980\nThen to truly break the cycle, you have\n\n1521\n01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,620\nto die.\n\n1522\n01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,740\nWhat does that mean?\n\n1523\n01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,320\nA long time ago, a young woman named\n\n1524\n01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,060\nKimberly Corman found herself on death's list, just\n\n1525\n01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,040\nlike you.\n\n1526\n01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,920\nAnd when her turn finally came, she died.\n\n1527\n01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,300\nFlatlined.\n\n1528\n01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,780\nBut her doctor managed to bring her back,\n\n1529\n01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,560\nand that broke the chain.\n\n1530\n01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:54,800\nAll right, then.\n\n1531\n01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,280\nWe'll do that.\n\n1532\n01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,580\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n1533\n01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,040\nWhy didn't Iris try that?\n\n1534\n01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,140\nIt's risky.\n\n1535\n01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:04,599\nAnd if you fuck with death and lose,\n\n1536\n01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:08,020\nthings can get very messy.\n\n1537\n01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,550\nHang on, hang on.\n\n1538\n01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:13,030\nOkay, wait.\n\n1539\n01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,630\nNo, there has to be another way.\n\n1540\n01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:17,310\nPlease, you have to help us.\n\n1541\n01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,869\nFor years, people have been coming to me\n\n1542\n01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:20,490\nfor advice.\n\n1543\n01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,329\nWell, I'm tired.\n\n1544\n01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,270\nI'm done with all that.\n\n1545\n01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,710\nAnd now I'm sick just like Iris.\n\n1546\n01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,770\nThere's no running this time.\n\n1547\n01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:33,430\nFact is, you're all gonna die.\n\n1548\n01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:37,110\nAnd after that, I will, too.\n\n1549\n01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,650\nNow that my old friend is gone, I'm\n\n1550\n01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,170\nretiring.\n\n1551\n01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,050\nSo what?\n\n1552\n01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,290\nYou're just gonna leave us here?\n\n1553\n01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:47,370\nWe need your help.\n\n1554\n01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:47,890\nWhere are you going?\n\n1555\n01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,790\nI intend to enjoy the time I have\n\n1556\n01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:52,250\nleft.\n\n1557\n01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,890\nAnd I suggest that you do the same.\n\n1558\n01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,990\nLife is precious.\n\n1559\n01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,170\nEnjoy every single second.\n\n1560\n01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,570\nYou never know when.\n\n1561\n01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,460\nGood luck.\n\n1562\n01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,560\nThat's fantastic.\n\n1563\n01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,300\nNo.\n\n1564\n01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,440\nNo, that can't be it.\n\n1565\n01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:23,760\nNo.\n\n1566\n01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,360\nThere has to be something here.\n\n1567\n01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,020\nThere has to be another answer.\n\n1568\n01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:29,480\nSteph.\n\n1569\n01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,720\nSteph, he gave us an answer.\n\n1570\n01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,560\nBobby's gotta die.\n\n1571\n01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:35,620\nEric!\n\n1572\n01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,620\nAre you fucking insane?\n\n1573\n01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,480\nWe're not killing Bobby.\n\n1574\n01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,000\nWhoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n1575\n01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,420\nAm I the only guy that just listened\n\n1576\n01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:40,940\nto that dude?\n\n1577\n01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,420\nThere's only one way.\n\n1578\n01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,880\nWe kill Bobby, we resuscitate him, and then,\n\n1579\n01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,540\nboom, you're all off death's list.\n\n1580\n01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,080\nCongratulations.\n\n1581\n01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,980\nThere has to be something else, right?\n\n1582\n01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,480\nI mean, there has to be another solution,\n\n1583\n01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,220\nright, Steph?\n\n1584\n01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:52,840\nNo.\n\n1585\n01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,980\nNo, there's nothing else we can do, okay?\n\n1586\n01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,560\nIt's over.\n\n1587\n01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:58,680\nWe'll be done.\n\n1588\n01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,460\nStephen, listen to me.\n\n1589\n01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,300\nYou gotta trust me on this one, okay?\n\n1590\n01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,640\nShe's giving up on you.\n\n1591\n01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,940\nI'm not going to.\n\n1592\n01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,340\nLook, Iris found a way to hold death\n\n1593\n01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,300\noff for decades.\n\n1594\n01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,720\nSo will we.\n\n1595\n01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:13,880\nI trust that guy.\n\n1596\n01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,040\nYou trust that guy?\n\n1597\n01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:15,680\nHe was funny.\n\n1598\n01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,420\nThat just went there.\n\n1599\n01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,560\nHe was just oddly charismatic, and you know\n\n1600\n01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,600\nthat as well as I do.\n\n1601\n01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,400\nUh...\n\n1602\n01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,260\nEric and Bobby are gone.\n\n1603\n01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:36,800\nShit.\n\n1604\n01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:37,880\nShit!\n\n1605\n01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,700\nI don't think I like this.\n\n1606\n01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,340\nHey, dude, we're in a hospital.\n\n1607\n01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:42,780\nRemember?\n\n1608\n01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:43,780\nThere's doctors everywhere.\n\n1609\n01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,100\nWe kill you, they bring you back.\n\n1610\n01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,140\nEverybody's safe.\n\n1611\n01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,540\nWe're heroes.\n\n1612\n01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,500\nThat is literally the opposite of keeping me\n\n1613\n01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:50,600\nsafe.\n\n1614\n01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,160\nWhat's the alternative, huh?\n\n1615\n01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,280\nYou want to kill someone and take the\n\n1616\n01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,080\ntime they have left?\n\n1617\n01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:56,580\nHow?\n\n1618\n01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,960\nHow would you even know how many years\n\n1619\n01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,360\nthey have?\n\n1620\n01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,460\nNo.\n\n1621\n01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:06,900\nNo.\n\n1622\n01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,320\nNo.\n\n1623\n01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,400\nWell, I mean, no.\n\n1624\n01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:11,780\nNo.\n\n1625\n01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,440\nOf course not.\n\n1626\n01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:12,840\nOf course not.\n\n1627\n01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:13,500\nWe would do that, right?\n\n1628\n01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,340\nNo, we would never.\n\n1629\n01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,380\nDon't touch those babies.\n\n1630\n01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,380\nLook, bottom line...\n\n1631\n01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,260\nFlatlining's your best option.\n\n1632\n01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,500\nWhat do you have to lose?\n\n1633\n01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,020\nOkay, all
