Louis.\n\n1129\n01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:20,083\nBefore that, it was\npassed to Louis by a cop in Jersey.\n\n1130\n01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:22,083\nThat cop was the\nfirst one I tried to contact,\n\n1131\n01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,625\nbut I guess he went off the grid.\n\n1132\n01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,666\nThe cop caught it from some\ndoctor who got it from a patient,\n\n1133\n01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:27,041\nwho got it from a college professor,\n\n1134\n01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,000\nand the chain keeps going back.\n\n1135\n01:18:29,000 -->
