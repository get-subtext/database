knew you were in and out of foster care\n\n254\n00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,800\nyour entire childhood\nand that you didn't know\n\n255\n00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,560\nthe meaning of family until\nyou hooked up with these two.\n\n256\n00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:19,360\nAnd so the three of you have been working\nyour little Robin Hood act for years now,\n\n257\n00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,600\ntrying to change the\nworld one trick at a time,\n\n258\n00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,880\nall leading to your riskiest theft to date,\nmy identity.\n\n259\n00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:25,920\n- You were there?\n\n260\n00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:29,000\n- You had our faces plastered on every\nscaffolding and subway stop in the city.\n\n261\n00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,160\nThat's copyright infringement,\nby the way, of course I was there.\n\n262\n00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:33,360\nSo what'd you think?\n\n263\n00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,760\n- I think your merit needs work.\n\n264\n00:12:35,761 -->

00:16:11,720\nthe Monaco championship\nfor the seventh time.\n\n341\n00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,680\nThe Mahle will produce.\n\n342\n00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:16,600\nNext?\n\n343\n00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,280\n- Right, pricing.\n\n344\n00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,120\nThe minimums that you've set for--\n\n345\n00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:23,880\n- Will you humor me, William,\nin a demonstration about reality?\n\n346\n00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:29,320\nThis diamond is, say, what, 35 carats.\n\n347\n00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,680\nThe AWDC would price it\nat three million US dollars.\n\n348\n00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:38,560\nWilliam, will you open your\nmouth and stick out your tartar?\n\n349\n00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:42,560\nNow.\n\n350\n00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:46,760\n- Really?\n\n351\n00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,761\n- Really.\n\n352\n00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120\n(suspenseful music)\n\n353\n00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:59,640\nNow, if William here were to swallow it,\n\n354\n00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,440\nthat selfsame diamond\nwould tear his throat to shreds.\n\n355\n00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:07,040\nHe would bleed to death\nbefore paramedics arrived.\n\n356\n00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:12,200\nSo to the AWDC, it's three million,\nbut to William, priceless.\n\n357\n00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:18,680\nTell me then, as the CEO responsible\nfor the world's last great diamond mines,\n\n358\n00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,304\nshould I undercut our\nprofits or should I choose\n\n359\n00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:24,440\nprices that I know our\nunique clients will pay?\n\n360\n00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:31,040\nAs I thought.\n\n361\n00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,480\nNow.\n\n362\n00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:39,787\nUnless there are more concerns,\nI would like to head\n\n363\n00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:44,760\nto Antwerp with my price\nlist and show off our stones.\n\n364\n00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,080\n- Uh, you know, you probably\ncould have led with free trip to Europe.\n\n365\n00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,160\n- You know,\na little known fact about Antwerp is that--\n\n366\n00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,440\n- Oh, great, more magic trivia.\n\n367\n00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,280\nThis is fun.\n\n368\n00:17:58,281 --> 00:17:59,920\n- No, I was just gonna say\nthat they make great biscuits.\n\n369\n00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:00,760\n- Oh, do they?\n\n370\n00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:01,680\nCan we actually get some, please?\n\n371\n00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,840\n- On Atlas, obviously. - No, no, no.\n\n372\n00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:04,800\nI'm not getting you biscuits.\n\n373\n00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,960\nI just got you chocolates, okay?\n\n374\n00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,640\nAll right, listen,\nthis is not a vacation, okay?\n\n375\n00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,440\nWe have three days to prepare an effect\n\n376\n00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:14,480\nthat'll make your barely passable Pepper's\nGhost Rift look like a cave painting.\n\n377\n00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,480\nAll right, come here.\n\n378\n00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,360\nThe heart diamond,\nthe most valuable jewel in history,\n\n379\n00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:25,120\nand the foundation of the\nVanderburg Mining Corporation.\n\n380\n00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:29,480\nNow, for years,\nthe families kept this big rock\n\n381\n00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:34,480\nhidden inside their secret vault,\n70 stories underground.\n\n382\n00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,760\nAnd not just any ground,\nthe Arabian Desert.\n\n383\n00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,080\nNo one beyond their most\ntrusted team has been inside.\n\n384\n00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:58,160\nAccess through a single elevator\nconstantly monitored by armed guards.\n\n385\n00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:01,160\n- Identity verified.\n\n386\n00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:04,120\n- And behind a multi-level\nbiometric security system.\n\n387\n00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:15,713\nBut the world will be watching,\nbecause for the first time\n\n388\n00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:20,120\nin half a century,\nthat diamond is being traveled here.\n\n389\n00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:25,680\nTo Antwerp to establish credibility\nand to start bidding at a private auction\n\n390\n00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,200\nfor the company's latest\nfinds in three days' time.\n\n391\n00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,280\n- Okay, obviously I'm down for stealing,\nbut what makes this diamond so special?\n\n392\n00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:34,080\n- Well, because the magical\ntarot card called us to June, right?\n\n393\n00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,120\n- Yeah, okay, that's very cute,\nbut can I please finish?\n\n394\n00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:36,960\n- You're not finished?\n\n395\n00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:37,960\nJeez, you've been talking forever.\n\n396\n00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:40,720\n- Yes, and I'm about to talk more,\nso please pay attention.\n\n397\n00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,880\nFor decades, first Peter Vanderburg,\n\n398\n00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,160\nnow his daughter Veronica,\nhave been selling these diamonds\n\n399\n00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:48,110\nat inflated prices to arms

dirty.\n\n402\n00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:55,694\nI mean, in some cases,\nit's literally blood-soaked, but then\n\n403\n00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,440\nvoila, it's cleaned in exchange\nfor these precious stones.\n\n404\n00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:01,200\nShe makes all the world's\nworst people possible.\n\n405\n00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,960\n- So whoever sent that tarot card--\n\n406\n00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,520\n- Are the few truly honorable\npeople left in this world,\n\n407\n00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:08,320\nthe only people that\nstill care about justice.\n\n408\n00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,800\nThey're people I haven't\nspoken to in a long time.\n\n409\n00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:12,062\nThey call themselves the Eye,\nand they want us\n\n410\n00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:14,840\nto do something that the\nhorsemen never could.\n\n411\n00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:17,773\n- This, man,\nthis is a chance to drive a\n\n412\n00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:19,880\nstake through the\nheart of the devil herself.\n\n413\n00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:20,720\n- Let's do it.\n\n414\n00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:27,440\n- All eyes will be on me and\nthe heart tonight at the auction.\n\n415\n00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:28,880\nI have to look dazzling.\n\n416\n00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,600\nDo you have that Kitten Kiss color?\n\n417\n00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,080\nLet's have both.\n\n418\n00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,920\n- Yes.\n\n419\n00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:40,200\n- Straw, who's that British\nphotographer from Vanity Fair?\n\n420\n00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,440\n- What's his name again?\n\n421\n00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,840\n- Mark, Mark Schreiber.\n\n422\n00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:45,880\n- Schreiber, good God.\n\n423\n00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:46,720\n- Schreiber.\n\n424\n00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,520\n- Confirm him, cancel the others.\n\n425\n00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,720\nWe went wild last year.\n\n426\n00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,720\nThis year,

time.\n\n959\n00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:24,360\nThey built a full city using mud,\ncardboard, lights,\n\n960\n00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:29,480\nthousands of inflatable rubber\ntanks to misdirect the

00:47:36,640\nTheives knew exactly\nwhere the blind spots were.\n\n977\n00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:42,680\n- How's it?\n\n978\n00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:46,720\n- Let me guess, you're the one behind these\nhorsemen in their little stable hands.\n\n979\n00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:50,480\n- No, why would I ask for the\ndiamond and then try to steal it?\n\n980\n00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:53,940\nIf I were

01:03:40,040\nthat I had him to myself,\nhe taught me a trick.\n\n1302\n01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:44,320\nHe would make a red silk handkerchief\ndisappear and then come back out of his mouth.\n\n1303\n01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,360\nI loved it.\n\n1304\n01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:52,000\nIt had just the right amount of flair,\nand I practiced that trick for months.\n\n1305\n01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:58,720\nI thought that if I could do it just right,\nI would earn more of him.\n\n1306\n01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:01,520\nBut that was the illusion.\n\n1307\n01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:04,680\nI've hated magic ever since.\n\n1308\n01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:07,840\nThe camp, the cheese, not to say anything\n\n1309\n01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:11,120\nof con artists like you\nwith your

mentalism.\n\n1317\n01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:37,960\nPeople wear their entire\nlife story on their face.\n\n1318\n01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,480\nYou just have to know how to read

01:04:49,200\n- This is gonna be fun.\n\n1323\n01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:53,960\nWell, you've already\nshared in excruciating detail\n\n1324\n01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:58,960\nyour daddy issues,\nbut I'm curious about your mom.\n\n1325\n01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:03,400\nWhy did she commit suicide?\n\n1326\n01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:10,400\nWas she as desperate for your\nfather's attention as you were?\n\n1327\n01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:15,160\nOoh, she was.\n\n1328\n01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,040\nAnd why was that?\n\n1329\n01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:20,800\nDid your father give his\nattention to someone else?\n\n1330\n01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,400\nWhen you tuck your hair behind your ear,\nthat's a tell.\n\n1331\n01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:28,760\nHe was.\n\n1332\n01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:33,520\nSo was he banging his secretary?\n\n1333\n01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:36,400\nNo, that's too cliche.\n\n1334\n01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:43,680\nBut it had to be someone close to your\nmom for her to, a good friend, hairdresser.\n\n1335\n01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:48,080\nWasn't the housekeeper, was it?\n\n1336\n01:05:48,081 --> 01:05:52,240\nNo, not the housekeeper.\n\n1337\n01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:54,440\nI don't have time for this.\n\n1338\n01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:57,120\n- And that's what people\nusually say when I'm getting hot.\n\n1339\n01:05:57,121 --> 01:06:00,240\nShould we crank up the AC,\nmaybe open a window?\n\n1340\n01:06:00,241 --> 01:06:05,240\nNow, if my dad was having\nsex with my housekeeper\n\n1341\n01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:08,880\nand my mom found out\nand committed suicide,\n\n1342\n01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:13,880\nI probably wouldn't cut the\nbrakes on my housekeeper's car.\n\n1343\n01:06:13,881 --> 01:06:18,360\nBut then again, I'm not a psychopath.\n\n1344\n01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,880\n- You are a sad and pathetic man.\n\n1345\n01:06:22,881 --> 01:06:25,840\nI can see why you want to end it.\n\n1346\n01:06:25,841 -->

introducing a new\ncar this weekend in Abu Dhabi.\n\n1450\n01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:21,480\nSo if we can get Merritt back\nand expose her-- - No, no,\n\n1451\n01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,000\nno, I am not

what we do next.\n\n1464\n01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:49,160\n- Of course it should. - Exactly.\n\n1465\n01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:52,600\n- No, it shouldn't, Atlas,\nand I think we should expose Vanessa.\n\n1466\n01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:55,840\n- Veronica. - Veronica, for murder, and what is the other thing?\n- Money laundering.\n\n1467\n01:13:55,841 --> 01:13:58,720\n- And for money laundering,\nfor murder and for money laundering.\n\n1468\n01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:00,500\nWe should tie her up. - No, no, no.\n\n1469\n01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:03,520\nIt is too dangerous, and Atlas is right.\n\n1470\n01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:04,760\n- We are done sacrificing ourselves.\n\n1471\n01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:05,580\nI'm sorry, it's not worth it.\n\n1472\n01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:07,120\n- That's bullshit.\n\n1473\n01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:08,560\n- What? - You're wrong.\n\n1474\n01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:09,780\n- Am I?\n\n1475\n01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:10,680\n- Sorry.\n\n1476\n01:14:10,681

didn't give a shit about anything.\n\n1479\n01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:24,740\nMy family gave me up.\n\n1480\n01:14:24,741 --> 01:14:26,000\nI hated the whole world.\n\n1481\n01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:30,920\nAnd then I saw a video of you guys,\n\n1482\n01:14:30,921 --> 01:14:35,914\nand you were trying to\nmake the world less corrupt,\n\n1483\n01:14:35,915 --> 01:14:42,600\nless

01:14:56,640\n- I promise this is gonna work.\n\n1487\n01:14:56,641 --> 01:14:58,840\n- But is that enough misdirection?\n\n1488\n01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:01,760\n- As long as she's here and not there.\n\n1489\n01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:02,600\n- We can take care of that.\n\n1490\n01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:04,920\n- If you're even just five minutes late.\n\n1491\n01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:06,320\n- Five, I'd say one.\n\n1492\n01:15:06,321 --> 01:15:07,160\n- One minute late.\n\n1493\n01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:09,040\n- How do we know enough\npeople are gonna show up?\n\n1494\n01:15:09,041 -->

01:22:23,760\nYou're just gonna stand there\nwalking or get my car back?\n\n1638\n01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:27,200\nYou did this.\n\n1639\n01:22:27,201 --> 01:22:32,880\n- Okay, here we

thing's tailhacked.\n\n1643\n01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:53,360\n- We fell through the\ntrap door or something.\n\n1644\n01:22:53,361 --> 01:22:54,200\n- Is everybody okay?\n\n1645\n01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:55,040\n- Where are we?\n\n1646\n01:22:55,041 --> 01:23:02,280\nWhen I woke up this morning, there was only\none thing I wanted more than my diamond.\n\n1647\n01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:04,640\nMy horsemen under lock and key.\n\n1648\n01:23:04,641 --> 01:23:10,120\nAnd now that I have both, I must\nadmit I'm feeling a little bit spoiled.\n\n1649\n01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:14,440\nWhile you were prepping your little\nperformance, I curated a trick of my own.\n\n1650\n01:23:14,441 --> 01:23:17,720\nFive horsemen, trapped, no escape.\n\n1651\n01:23:17,721 --> 01:23:21,760\nYou five may be national treasures,\nbut we have those here too.\n\n1652\n01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:25,680\nOnly they're hard to find\nbecause they're buried in sand.\n\n1653\n01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,640\nTo the world it will appear\nyou died in a failed escape act.\n\n1654\n01:23:34,641 --> 01:23:37,560\nNow, let's see some magic.\n\n1655\n01:23:37,561 --> 01:23:42,520\n- Fuck magic, somebody call for backup.\n\n1656\n01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:43,760\n- Jack, call June.\n\n1657\n01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:44,800\n- Anyone have service?\n\n1658\n01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:46,560\n- God,\nshe must have scrambled the cell signal.\n\n1659\n01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:47,720\nShe thought of everything.\n\n1660\n01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:49,160\n- Lula, whose side are you on?\n\n1661\n01:23:49,161 --> 01:23:51,600\n- I'm on our side, obviously,\nbut she also thought of everything.\n\n1662\n01:23:51,601 --> 01:23:53,120\nBoth things can be true at one time.\n\n1663\n01:23:53,121 --> 01:23:55,120\n- The sand is getting higher,\nthe sand is getting bigger.\n\n1664\n01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:56,680\nThis is more sand and it's getting larger.\n\n1665\n01:23:56,681 --> 01:23:58,880\n- Henley, Henley,\nfirst principle of escape.\n\n1666\n01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:00,960\nOh, is, how long is this survivable?\n\n1667\n01:24:00,961 --> 01:24:01,800\n- Right. - Okay, great.\n\n1668\n01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:05,320\nJudging from the rate of the flow,\nthe volume of the box, yeah, we're screwed.\n\n1669\n01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:06,160\n- Oh, amazing.\n\n1670\n01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:08,160\nOkay, how about the second\nprinciple of escape then?\n\n1671\n01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:09,760\n- Okay, so that's the box itself.\n\n1672\n01:24:09,761 --> 01:24:12,080\nIt's your flaws, your weakness,\ntheir back door.\n\n1673\n01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:14,440\nEverybody just needs to check.\n\n1674\n01:24:14,441 --> 01:24:17,040\n- Seal, seal, seal, seal, seal.\n\n1675\n01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:21,320\n- Everything's sealed.\n\n1676\n01:24:21,321 --> 01:24:27,200\n- Any chance there's a third principle?\n\n1677\n01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,640\n(dramatic music)\n\n1678\n01:24:31,641 --> 01:24:36,000\n- I have what you're after.\n\n1679\n01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:39,280\n- Perfect,\nI will meet you where the heart resides.\n\n1680\n01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:41,520\n- I can hardly wait.\n\n1681\n01:24:41,521 --> 01:24:48,800\n- Straight to the vault.\n\n1682\n01:24:48,801 --> 01:24:51,560\n(dramatic music)\n\n1683\n01:24:51,561 --> 01:24:53,060\n- No, no, no, yes!\n\n1684\n01:24:53,061 --> 01:24:57,480\nHelp me, Ricky, Bobby, help me!\n\n1685\n01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,120\n(dramatic music)\n\n1686\n01:25:02,121 --> 01:25:03,240\n- Is this really gonna happen right now?\n\n1687\n01:25:03,241 --> 01:25:05,880\nWe're just gonna die here in this box,\nreally?\n\n1688\n01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:10,040\n- It's funny, a week ago,\nI wanted to die, and then I
