00:30:19,817\nWell, I like that.\n\n418\n00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,904\nBut if I did, our separate life forces\n\n419\n00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:27,659\nwould become one\nsingle force called a Codex.\n\n420\n00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,327\nWhat the hell is a Codex?\n\n421\n00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,620\nIt's a key.\n\n422\n00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,956\nA key that unlocks a

do?\n\n432\n00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,354\nShe can only see the Codex when\na symbiote is in its full true form.\n\n433\n00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,275\nRight.\n\n434\n00:31:01,651 -->

fully transform, the\nCodex sends her a tracking signal.\n\n438\n00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,206\nShe'll find us, rip it out of\nour spine, and free Knull from Klyntar.\n\n439\n00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,708\nSo how do we get rid of this Codex?\n\n440\n00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,878\nAs long as you and I\nboth live, the Codex exists.\n\n441\n00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,799\nIf one of us should\ndie, the Codex will die.\n\n442\n00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,967\nThat's not gonna work for me.\n\n443\n00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,342\nOr me.\n\n444\n00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,303\nThat
