fit...\n\n807\n01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:45,756\n...trying to divine\nwhat makes us unique.\n\n808\n01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,934\nOne day, a man\nmight be an inspector.\n\n809\n01:21:49,027 --> 01:21:51,947\nThe next, someone entirely different.\n\n810\n01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:55,302\nWhen they want to study\na murderer for instance...\n\n811\n01:21:55,680 --> 01:22:00,156\n...they simply imprint one of their\ncitizens with a new personality...\n\n812\n01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:04,518\n<i>...arrange a family for him,\nfriends, an entire history...</i>\n\n813\n01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:06,421\n<i>...even a lost wallet.</i>\n\n814\n01:22:06,892 --> 01:22:08,573\n<i>Then they observe the results.</i>\n\n815\n01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:11,513\nWill a man, given the history...\n\n816\n01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:14,088\n<i>...of a killer, continue in that vein?</i>\n\n817\n01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:18,142\nOr are we, in fact, more than\nthe mere sum of our memories?\n\n818\n01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:22,917\nThis business of you being a killer\nwas an unhappy coincidence.\n\n819\n01:22:23,388 --> 01:22:25,110\n<i>You have had dozens\nof lives before now.</i>\n\n820\n01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:26,704\nYou just happened...\n\n821\n01:22:26,784 --> 01:22:29,905\n<i>...to wake up while I was\nimprinting you with this one.</i>\n\n822\n01:22:30,425 --> 01:22:32,291\nWhy are they doing all of this?\n\n823\n01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:35,384\nIt is our capacity for individuality...\n\n824\n01:22:35,621 --> 01:22:38,423\n...our souls that makes\nus different from them.\n\n825\n01:22:38,483 --> 01:22:40,826\nThey think they can find\nthe human soul...\n\n826\n01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:43,658\n...if they understand\nhow our memories work.\n\n827\n01:22:44,175 --> 01:22:48,051\nAll they have are collective memories.\nThey share one group mind.\n\n828\n01:22:48,108 --> 01:22:49,628\nThey're dying, you see?\n\n829\n01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:52,828\nTheir entire race\nis on the brink of extinction.\n\n830\n01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:55,030\nThey think we can save them.\n\n831\n01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,528\n- Where do I fit in?\n- You are different, John.\n\n832\n01:22:58,149 --> 01:23:00,755\nYou resisted my attempt\nto imprint you.\n\n833\n01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,317\n<i>Somehow...</i>\n\n834\n01:23:06,429 --> 01:23:09,135\n...you have developed\ntheir ability to tune.\n\n835\n01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,980\nThat is how they change things.\nThat is how they built this city.\n\n836\n01:23:12,243 --> 01:23:14,960\nThey have machines buried deep\nbeneath the surface...\n\n837\n01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,836\n...that allow them to focus\ntheir telepathic energies.\n\n838\n01:23:19,844 --> 01:23:22,210\n<i>They control everything here,\neven the sun.</i>\n\n839\n01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:25,416\nThat's why it's always dark.\nThey can't stand the light.\n\n840\n01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,892\nSo why do they need you?\n\n841\n01:23:27,162 --> 01:23:30,907\nWhen they first brought us here,\nthey extracted what was in us.\n\n842\n01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:33,061\nSo they could store the information...\n\n843\n01:23:33,262 --> 01:23:35,209\n<i>...remix it like so much paint...</i>\n\n844\n01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,809\n...and give us back new memories\nof their choosing.\n\n845\n01:23:38,009 --> 01:23:41,460\nBut they still needed an artist\nto help them.\n\n846\n01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:46,424\nI understood the intricacies\nof the human mind...\n\n847\n01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,294\n...better than they ever could...\n\n848\n01:23:48,894 --> 01:23:51,823\n...so they allowed me\nto keep my skills as a scientist...\n\n849\n01:23:51,973 --> 01:23:53,311\n...because they needed them.\n\n850\n01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:55,692\nBut they made me\ndelete everything else.\n\n851\n01:24:04,275 --> 01:24:06,925\nCan you imagine what\nit is like being forced...\n\n852\n01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:08,823\n...to erase your own past?\n\n853\n01:24:09,023 --> 01:24:12,385\nWhat about my past?\nWhat about my childhood?\n\n854\n01:24:13,151 -->
