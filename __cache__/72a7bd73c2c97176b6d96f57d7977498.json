--> 01:43:57,380\nBecause I'm not rich?\n\n1806\n01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,730\n'Cause I didn't go to a\nBritish boarding school,\n\n1807\n01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:02,420\nor I wasn't born into\na wealthy family?\n\n1808\n01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,880\nYou're a foreigner.\nAmerican.\n\n1809\n01:44:04,929 --> 01:44:08,708\nAnd all Americans think about\nis their own

to build\nthings that last.\n\n1813\n01:44:16,849 --> 01:44:18,780\nSomething you know\nnothing about.\n\n1814\n01:44:21,694 --> 01:44:23,230\nYou don't know me.\n\n1815\n01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:25,990\nI know you're\nnot what Nick needs.\n\n1816\n01:44:30,814 --> 01:44:33,020\nWell, he proposed\nto me yesterday.\n\n1817\n01:44:38,207 --> 01:44:39,832\nHe said he'd walk\naway from his family\n\n1818\n01:44:39,864 --> 01:44:41,674\nand from you for good.\n\n1819\n01:44:46,305 --> 01:44:48,317\nDon't worry,\nI turned him down.\n\n1820\n01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:54,700\nOnly a fool folds\na winning hand.\n\n1821\n01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:56,552\nThere's no winning.\n\n1822\n01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,020\nYou made sure of that.\n\n1823\n01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:03,090\nBecause if Nick chose me,\nhe would lose his family.\n\n1824\n01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:07,640\nAnd if he chose his family,\n\n1825\n01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:11,168\nhe might spend the rest\nof his life resenting you.\n\n1826\n01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,513\nSo you chose for him.\n\n1827\n01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,447\nI'm not leaving\n'cause I'm scared.\n\n1828\n01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:39,110\nOr because I think\nI'm not enough.\n\n1829\n01:45:39,588 --> 01:45:43,660\nBecause maybe for\nthe first time in my life...\n\n1830\n01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:46,280\nI know I am.\n\n1831\n01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:50,530\nI just love Nick so much.\n\n1832\n01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,950\nI don't want him\nto lose his mom again.\n\n1833\n01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:03,480\nSo, I just wanted you\nto know that one
