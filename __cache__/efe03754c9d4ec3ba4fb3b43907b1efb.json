Then Japanese.\n\n28\n00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,219\nEven at point,\nwe thought of making them American.\n\n29\n00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,847\n(Alex) But the quarantine idea\neventually locked them down to the UK.\n\n30\n00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,579\nThis was really where we were gonna try\nand get as much exposition as we needed\n\n31\n00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,250\nout of the way in this opening sequence.\n\n32\n00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,339\nI suppose we've got\na little bit dropped in later,\n\n33\n00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,659\nbut we had this idea which was to set\nthe premise up as quickly as possible,\n\n34\n00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,045\nAnd then return to it\nas little as possible.\n\n35\n00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,779\n(Danny)\nIt looks very distressing for the chimps,\n\n36\n00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,008\nthe cages that they're in\nand the bed that he's lying on.\n\n37\n00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,739\nBut we were guided completely,\n\n38\n00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,979\nand took in what we were allowed\nto do and the sizes of the cages,\n\n39\n00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,579\nby the guy who looks after the chimps.\n\n40\n00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,684\nHe breeds them. He brings them up from birth\nand keeps them until they're in their 405.\n\n41\n00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,259\nInterestingly, one reason there are\nso few working chimps any more\n\n42\n00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,779\nis that because of recent legislation, they're\nnot allowed to put down chimps any more.\n\n43\n00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,139\nYou can only work them\nuntil they're seven or eight years old\n\n44\n00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,219\nand they live to about 40 or 50.\n\n45\n00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,419\nBut for the last 20 or 30 years of their\nlife they're very difficult to work with.\n\n46\n00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,842\nThis man works with them right through.\nAnd they adore him. They were wonderful.\n\n47\n00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,447\nThis is the setup, as\nAlex was talking about.\n\n48\n00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,779\nWhen I first read this scene, I thought\nwhat a wonderful premise it was for a film,\n\n49\n00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,859\nthis idea of a psychological virus.\n\n50\n00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,339\nWe've all seen movies\nwith viruses escaping,\n\n51\n00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,699\nbut they're usually some kind\nof biological or chemical agent.\n\n52\n00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,979\nBut the idea - which is fantasy, which is a\nslight sci-fi premise - of a psychological virus\n\n53\n00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,210\nI just think is a brilliant original idea and\na fantastic premise to start the film on.\n\n54\n00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,939\n(Alex) This sequence is interesting for me\n\n55\n00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,859\nbecause I think this scene more than any other\nis pure genre in the way that it's written.\n\n56\n00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,179\nBut in the way that it's shot\nand the way that Danny executed it,\n\n57\n00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,486\nit pulls it away from that.\n\n58\n00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,059\nIt was quite strange for me\nwatching this for the first time\n\n59\n00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:48,419\nbecause I had to get used\nto that different approach.\n\n60\n00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,859\nWith the rest of the film, it was supposed\nto be moving away from genre,\n\n61\n00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,979\nbut this felt almost like a set piece.\n\n62\n00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,684\nBut the execution of it,\nI think, is terrific.\n\n63\n00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,401\n(Danny) It's always useful to remember\nthe very first time you read a script.\n\n64\n00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,299\nThat's the last time you're as close in\nexperience to the audience's, seeing it fresh.\n\n65\n00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,139\nThis was the thing that stuck in my mind,\nthe use of the title - as a subtitle.\n\n66\n00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,419\nThere was no title.\nI thought that was brilliant. I love that.\n\n67\n00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,059\nSo we were determined\nnot to have any names up front.\n\n68\n00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,219\n(Alex) That's our Tootsie cut.\n\n69\n00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,059\n<i>(laughter)</i>\n\n70\n00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,979\nIn Tootsie Dustin Hoffman realises,\n\n71\n00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,979\nin order to make it as an actor,\nhe has to dress as a woman.\n\n72\n00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,059\nThen you just cut to him walking\ndown the street as a woman.\n\n73\n00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,059\nYou never show him dressing up.\nI think they show that later.\n\n74\n00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,969\nThat's what we did here.\nWe tried to cut to the chase.\n\n75\n00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,139\n(Danny) But we put him\nin green pyjamas instead.\n\n76\n00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,047\n(Alex) Or no pyjamas.\n\n77\n00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,406\n(Danny) There are two types\nof hospitals in Britain.\n\n78\n00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,579\nThere's the more Victorian type.\n\n79\n00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,659\nThen there's the modern type,\nusually associated with private healthcare.\n\n80\n00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,739\nBut this is a National Health\nhospital in Acton.\n\n81\n00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,659\nIt's a day hospital, for day operations.\nIt had a wonderful modern quality about it.\n\n82\n00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:29,419\nWe always try to emphasise\nthe modern in British life.\n\n83\n00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,819\nIt's just a choice,\nrather than looking backwards.\n\n84\n00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,179\nIt has a feeling about it almost of\na hotel, somehow, a modern hotel,\n\n85\n00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,979\nespecially in the wider shots coming up.\n\n86\n00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,019\nCillian was very worried\nabout doing these scenes naked.\n\n87\n00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,779\nWe had the usual closed set.\n\n88\n00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,691\nNobody was allowed to make any jokes\nall day in case they were misinterpreted.\n\n89\n00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,699\nWe made a big choice about\nwhether there were gonna be bodies.\n\n90\n00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,339\nIndeed we did shoot some bodies\nin this opening sequence,\n\n91\n00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,019\nbut we decided to follow\none of our instincts which was that,\n\n92\n00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,979\nrather than trying to litter\nthe world with corpses,\n\n93\n00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,979\nwe were better to make it almost symbolic.\n\n94\n00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,499\nThe emptiness of the place stood for\nsomething that had gone wrong\n\n95\n00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,001\nrather than specific reality of corpses\nlying around and blood everywhere.\n\n96\n00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,179\n(Alex) Atmosphere and surrealism\nover plot requirements.\n\n97\n00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,771\nIt's like an aesthetic decision.\n\n98\n00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,179\nBut it's something we've been picked up on.\n\"Why aren't there more bodies around?\"\n\n99\n00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,099\nThere's not really a good logical reason\nfor it in storytelling terms,\n\n100\n00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,739\nit's just because it\nfeels more interesting.\n\n101\n00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,444\nHopefully, that's a legitimate reason.\n\n102\n00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,139\n(Danny) My life, since I've become\ninvolved in making films,\n\n103\n00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,659\nhas centred around two questions so far.\n\n104\n00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,979\nOne was \"How did you get Ewan McGregor to\ncome out of the toilet in Trainspotting?\"\n\n105\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,699\nThe second was \"What was it like\nto work with Leonardo DiCaprio?\"\n\n106\n00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,659\nI'm grateful that both of them\nhave been replaced by\n\n107\n00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,699\n\"How did you shoot\nthe London scenes on this one?\"\n\n108\n00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,059\nThe answer is\nin the most obvious way you'd expect.\n\n109\n00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,499\nWe managed somehow to close the streets down,\nalbeit only for brief moments of time.\n\n110\n00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,819\nWe used multicameras -

That was created.\n\n630\n00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,339\n- (Alex) Maybe that's what they meant.\n- (Danny) The other one was from Cornwall.\n\n631\n00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:18,241\nIt was a lovely idea - ironically, something\nkept going that there's no use for any more.\n\n632\n00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,139\nThis is an abbey. We had to shoot this\nwithin the M25, or just beyond it,\n\n633\n00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,979\nbecause of financial reasons with the crew.\n\n634\n00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:34,419\nThe location manager, Alex Gladstone, found\nthis for us, which I'd never seen before.\n\n635\n00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:40,499\nWhen you get a good crew working,\npeople add things to the script.\n\n636\n00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,779\nHe brought this idea up\nof somewhere to stop for a picnic,\n\n637\n00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,099\nand I loved the idea of the past again.\n\n638\n00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,419\nThat they were surrounded by\nsomething very, very old.\n\n639\n00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,851\nAnd the horses were very beautiful.\n\n640\n00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,939\nBut one area that looked like it had been\ndestroyed before in a previous generation,\n\n641\n00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,659\na previous civilisation had collapsed.\n\n642\n00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:09,299\nIt looks like that Max Ernst painting\ncalled After the Rain, Aprés la Déluge -\n\n643\n00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,779\nwell, the next scene does\nwhen they're walking around.\n\n644\n00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,179\nThat was done after the war,\nto suggest the ruin of Europe.\n\n645\n00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,019\nAnyway, that was the idea of it.\n\n646\n00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,851\nBut that's what happens when people get involved\nin the script... I've run out of space.\n\n647\n00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:31,579\n(Alex) In this scene, it's really our first\nattempt, having laid a little bit of groundwork,\n\n648\n00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:37,525\nto try and create a relationship spark\nbetween the two of them.\n\n649\n00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,339\nI probably went over this scene\nmore than any other,\n\n650\n00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,339\nbecause this was the scene that we were\nusing in casting of the two of them.\n\n651\n00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:53,659\nSo we heard this scene again and again\nand again with lots of different actors.\n\n652\n00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,059\nAfter all of that, for a while,\nwe dropped it out of the film.\n\n653\n00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,139\nThis was cut for a while, this scene.\n\n654\n00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,699\nIt came back again\nbecause something needed to happen\n\n655\n00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:12,171\nwhere the two of them just got closer\nin the boy-meets-girl way of things.\n\n656\n00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,579\nIn a way, it's more to do with Selena\nthan it is to do with Jim.\n\n657\n00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:29,243\nIt's part of her moving away\nfrom this machinelike take on the world.\n\n658\n00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:37,699\nAnd it's as much to do with her noticing\nHannah and Frank messing around on the cab\n\n659\n00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,801\nthat then comes back later.\n\n660\n00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:51,288\n(Danny) I love this look she gives here.\nLike that. Really great.\n\n661\n00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,139\nThis is the Valium scene.\n\n662\n00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,299\nAt one point, this was gonna be\na much harder drug.\n\n663\n00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,579\nIt was gonna be Class-A drugs at one point.\n\n664\n00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,539\n(Alex) Danny in his Trainspotting history,\nwanting them shooting up.\n\n665\n00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,419\n(Danny) Because I thought\nif it was 28 days later,\n\n666\n00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,099\nand she was a chemist,\nand you had access to all that,\n\n667\n00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,939\nyou could use stuff like that,\nbut it was too extreme.\n\n668\n00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,659\nAnd it moved the film\ninto a different world.\n\n669\n00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,739\nBut if you wanted pain relief\nor to be able to create...\n\n670\n00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,219\n(Alex) Valium works for\npain relief, I find.\n\n671\n00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,369\n(Danny) ..absence in your brain,\nthen this is how they do it in this.\n\n672\n00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,967\n(Alex) Actually, it's a \"dad\" moment.\n\n673\n00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,179\nIt's Jim having decided now\nthat Frank is his surrogate dad.\n\n674\n00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,819\nHe talks to him like he's a kid.\n\n675\n00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:53,242\nHe's the brother of his younger sister,\nHannah, in a way.\n\n676\n00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,979\nSort of treating the Valium\nlike it's chocolate cake.\n\n677\n00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,379\n\"Come on, let her have a bit.\"\n\n678\n00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,847\n(Danny) The idea of family in it\nis very important throughout it all.\n\n679\n00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,419\n(Alex) Soon he'll actually call him\nDad, subtly. Blink and you miss it.\n\n680\n00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,122\n(Danny) But he does, yeah.\n\n681\n00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,443\nThis is like their rest, really.\n\n682\n00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,139\nThat's probably like\nthe most relaxed they'll ever be.\n\n683\n00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,242\nInside it, or course, is\na slight poison, really.\n\n684\n00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,844\n- (Alex) Which is this.\n- (Danny) His paranoia.\n\n685\n00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:52,299\nBecause the scar of being left alone at the\nbeginning of the film has left its mark.\n\n686\n00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,979\nHis worst nightmare is that he's been left\nalone again, that they've gone and left him.\n\n687\n00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,019\n- (Alex) That's more of Andrew's camerawork.\n- (Danny) Scaring some sheep.\n\n688\n00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,219\nAnd I can't guarantee that he didn't harm\nthe sheep in that particular shot.\n\n689\n00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,739\nI think he just shouted at them,\nbut I can't guarantee it.\n\n690\n00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,241\nThey actually did it with some sheepdogs,\nthen they took them out later.\n\n691\n00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,401\nHere's the bit that Alex was referring to,\nwhere he just...\n\n692\n00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,539\nwants a dad.\n\n693\n00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:32,379\nBut he can't, really.\nThe idea of it was that he's got to take..\n\n694\n00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:37,699\nEventually he finds another father figure\nwho's a much more patrician figure,\n\n695\n00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,779\nplayed by Chris Eccleston later.\n\n696\n00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:45,699\nHe has to do that work himself, in the end.\nHe can't keep relying on a father figure.\n\n697\n00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,739\n(Alex) One of the questions\nthat I keep getting asked\n\n698\n00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,779\nis why it takes them two days\nto drive up to just north of Manchester.\n\n699\n00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,019\nDanny has the answer to that.\n\n700\n00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,059\n- (Danny) Do I?\n- (Alex) Yes. Don't you? I don't.\n\n701\n00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,659\n- (Danny) Why does it take them two days?\n- (Alex) It just does.\n\n702\n00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,285\nWe thought they should\nspend the night somewhere, so they do.\n\n703\n00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,139\nYou can get obsessed about...\n\n704\n00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,299\nAs anyone can tell, we're quite\ncavalier about that kind of thing.\n\n705\n00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,289\nIf we think \"Let's make it two days\",\nthen that's what happens.\n\n706\n00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,579\nThere's one of my favourite moments here,\n\n707\n00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:32,047\nwhich is Jim putting his hand\nout the window.\n\n708\n00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,779\nIt's something I always used to do\nwhen I was a kid. I still do it, actually.\n\n709\n00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,963\nTreating your hand like an aerofoil\non long journeys.\n\n710\n00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:45,419\nGoing on holiday with the family.\n\n711\n00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,659\nDad saying \"Stick your hand back in\nor it'll get ripped off.\"\n\n712\n00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,859\n<i>(Danny) This is the NH,\nwhich is the busiest motorway in Britain.</i>\n\n713\n00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,059\nWe were unbelievably fortunate -\n\n714\n00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:02,499\nwe contacted these policemen\nand they were very keen to help us do it.\n\n715\n00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,499\nThey created a \"rolling block\"\nin both directions,\n\n716\n00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,459\nwhere they drive in front of traffic\ncoming in both directions, very slowly,\n\n717\n00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,979\nand create this diminishing corridor\nwhere there appears to be no traffic.\n\n718\n00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,299\nIt's just being held back\nby them driving at 10 miles an hour.\n\n719\n00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,779\nSo the stuff in front of them clears.\n\n720\n00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,579\nWe had seven or eight minutes\nwhere we could shoot.\n\n721\n00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,659\nAgain, we used lots of cameras.\n\n722\n00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,899\nI'm on a camera inside\nthe cab, on that shot.\n\n723\n00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,444\nAnthony's following this\ncab in another cab.\n\n724\n00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:37,968\nAndrew's up on a crane, I think,\ngetting a wide shot.\n\n725\n00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:43,619\nThis is actually picked up later.\nWe did this somewhere else.\n\n726\n00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,299\nIt does affect the actors to see something for\nreal, rather than paint it all out afterwards.\n\n727\n00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:53,659\nYou do see it affect them.\nIt helps them enter the world of it.\n\n728\n00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,739\n(Alex) This was very tricky.\n\n729\n00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,219\nHow do you show a city\nburning from a huge distance,\n\n730\n00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,059\nand still make it look dramatic,\n\n731\n00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,619\nstill justify the long... pan?\n\n732\n00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,699\n<i>(laughter)</i>\n\n733\n00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,579\n- (Danny) Tilt, actually.\n- (Alex) Oh, fuck it.\n\n734\n00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,282\nThe long tilt.\n\n735\n00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,521\nThe long tracking shot upwards.\n\n736\n00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,219\nThat's Manchester burning.\nAnd that's my hometown.\n\n737\n00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,739\nWhat better town to burn\nthan your hometown?\n\n738\n00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,259\nAnd Alex went to university there.\n\n739\n00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,299\nThere's a common thread there.\n\n740\n00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,259\n(Alex) This was the most amazing set.\n\n741\n00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:41,339\n(Danny) Yeah, this is our roadblock,\nwhich we did on a test-drive track\n\n742\n00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:46,179\nwhere they test out car tyres\nand braking distances and stuff like that.\n\n743\n00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:51,219\nYou often see those shows on television\nwhere they're testing different cars,\n\n744\n00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,819\nthose Jeremy Clarkson-type shows,\nthis is where they're all filmed.\n\n745\n00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:59,259\nTildesley, our designer, did a brilliant\njob creating with very little\n\n746\n00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,179\nthis sense of a blockade\nwhich has been abandoned.\n\n747\n01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,779\n(Alex) You could look at it from any angle.\n\n748\n01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:13,179\nIt never felt like you'd walked behind it and\nwere seeing the scaffold that's holding it up.\n\n749\n01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,568\nIt was a completely contained 3-D world.\n\n750\n01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,299\nWalking around it, you'd suddenly feel\nas if you were walking into the film\n\n751\n01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,005\nas you walked past\nsome burned-up corpse or upturned car.\n\n752\n01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,499\n(Danny) Again, the images that we tried to\nuse was that things had been abandoned.\n\n753\n01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,019\nIt's that Mary Celeste image\nwhich is so evocative,\n\n754\n01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,699\nthat things have just been left,\njust abandoned,\n\n755\n01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,259\nrather than seeing corpses everywhere.\n\n756\n01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:56,046\nWe have to have corpses at certain points\nlike we do later in this sequence.\n\n757\n01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:00,819\nThere's more the feeling\nof just desolation, really.\n\n758\n01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,659\nThey always say \"Hell is other people\",\n\n759\n01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:08,339\nbut the premise of this\nis that hell is no other people,\n\n760\n01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:13,887\nthat when you're truly alone,\nit's a terrible thing.\n\n761\n01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:21,219\nThis is one of my favourite moments in the\nwhole film, where he just snaps at them.\n\n762\n01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,130\n- (Alex) And he is Dad.\n- (Danny) And he's such a total dad, Brendan.\n\n763\n01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,779\nHis performance here of snapping at them,\nand then he walks away and regrets it.\n\n764\n01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,099\nHe thinks \"Why did I do that?\"\n\n765\n01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,299\nAnd they also did really well.\n\n766\n01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,971\nIt's a wonderful moment\nof them being three told-off children.\n\n767\n01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,962\n\"Dad's in a bad, bad mood and he's got\na big, heavy lead pipe in his hand.\"\n\n768\n01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:54,699\nBut his regret then and what happens,\nironically, to him is sad.\n\n769\n01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,859\nBut he gets a chance\nto apologise to her, which I love,\n\n770\n01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,779\nthe fact that he apologises\nfor what he'd just done.\n\n771\n01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:06,179\nHe knows he's gonna die but he gets\na chance to actually say something,\n\n772\n01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,059\nsomething that his daughter\ncan remember him by.\n\n773\n01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:12,579\n(Alex) This death came\nquite late in the day.\n\n774\n01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:19,779\nFor a long time it was dogs, but dogs\nreally screwed around with a few things.\n\n775\n01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,859\nThey were very expensive to use,\n\n776\n01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:27,059\nbut also if there were infected dogs,\nthen all animals would be infected.\n\n777\n01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,899\nOne of the many rules we ignored\nwas that it was primates.\n\n778\n01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,365\nThat's a fantastic shot.\n\n779\n01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:40,139\nThat's our second emotional point\nin the film, really.\n\n780\n01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,099\n(Danny) Yeah. I loved\nhow emotional this scene was,\n\n781\n01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,259\nin something that you could call\na zombie film or a horror film.\n\n782\n01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:53,579\nThat you did get a chance to really\nemotionally grieve for these people,\n\n783\n01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,539\nand get put on the spot\nabout what is gonna happen now.\n\n784\n01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,699\nNot just in terms of violence\nor who's gonna get killed,\n\n785\n01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:05,859\nbut emotionally in terms of how\nthey're gonna say goodbye to each other.\n\n786\n01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:11,361\nPeople trying to work out what's going on,\nthen having to do something about it.\n\n787\n01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,019\n(Alex) It might be a measure of\nme and Danny being a bit sad, I don't know.\n\n788\n01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,419\nBut there was one rehearsal...\nDo you remember this?\n\n789\n01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,939\nThey were rehearsing this scene,\na couple of months before filming it,\n\n790\n01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,819\nand we got choked up.\n\n791\n01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,419\nIt was pathetic in a way, but it happened.\n\n792\n01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,964\nI shouldn't say that. Cut that.\n\n793\n01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,979\n(Danny) That point,\nwhere the soldiers shoot him,\n\n794\n01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,899\nis an end point\nwhere a different version of the film -\n\n795\n01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:48,139\nwhich we hope to be able to show you\non the extras, storyboarded - kicks in,\n\n796\n01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,699\nbefore the solders shoot him.\n\n797\n01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:55,724\nBut I won't say any more about that now.\nHopefully that'll appear on the DVD extras.\n\n798\n01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,299\nThe soldiers' costumes are done\nby Rachael Fleming, our costume designer.\n\n799\n01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,619\nWhen she first showed me them, I thought\n\n800\n01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,539\n\"These are way too extreme.\nWe won't get away with this.\"\n\n801\n01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,779\nThey're in total bio gear\nto protect themselves.\n\n802\n01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,819\nBut, of course, she was right.\n\n803\n01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,259\nWhen you get the energy of the scene,\nand they come into the scene,\n\n804\n01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,179\nit's exactly that kind\nof alien thing that you want.\n\n805\n01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,979\nTheir first sight of other survivors is\nalmost like they come from a different planet\n\n806\n01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,179\nbefore they begin to get to know them,\nas they do here.\n\n807\n01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:31,579\n(Alex) This is our really big\ncontinuity error coming.\n\n808\n01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,659\n(Danny) You mean Marvin, on the right?\n\n809\n01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:39,939\nThat's Marvin, who you'll see later appearing\nas the chained-up Mailer, already infected.\n\n810\n01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,259\nThat's because we changed cast\nafter we'd shot that film\n\n811\n01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:48,179\nand promoted Marvin into\nthe part of Mailer.\n\n812\n01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:52,699\nWe had to keep it in. We hoped no one would\nnotice, cos you haven't met Mailer yet.\n\n813\n01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,859\nAnd your eye is really taken\nby the introduction of this character,\n\n814\n01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,739\nChris Eccleston,\nwho's one of my personal favourite actors.\n\n815\n01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,046\nI've worked with him a number of times.\n\n816\n01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:09,881\nChris always brings something\nextraordinary to parts that he plays.\n\n817\n01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:16,579\nAnd this is the next father figure\nfor Cillian to put his faith in.\n\n818\n01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,819\nThis is a much more authoritarian figure,\n\n819\n01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:23,339\nobviously because he's got\nthe might of the British army...\n\n820\n01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,939\nor a section of the British army\nwith him to protect them.\n\n821\n01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:31,486\nHe invites them into\nthe British country house.\n\n822\n01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:36,445\nIt wouldn't be a British film\nwithout a country house in it.\n\n823\n01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,779\n(Alex) We were trying to set up different\ncharacters there with the soldiers.\n\n824\n01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:57,485\nJones standing there forlornly\nwith his shopping bags.\n\n825\n01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,019\nThis was moved around.\n\n826\n01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,219\nIn one cut of the film...\n\n827\n01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:10,099\nOriginally it was a lot further back and\nit was brought forward, this whole scene.\n\n828\n01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,739\nIt used to appear much later in the film.\n\n829\n01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,819\nIt was interesting for me,\nwatching this editing process,\n\n830\n01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:23,242\nand seeing just exactly how much\none can change the thread of the story\n\n831\n01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,642\nin the edit suite.\n\n832\n01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,419\n- And they weren't in the same room.\n- (Danny) They weren't.\n\n833\n01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,819\nWe put them in the same room together.\n\n834\n01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,139\nYou often do, you concertina\nthings that you keep separate.\n\n835\n01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:46,019\nIt's often better, especially once the film\nis moving on into its second or third stage.\n\n836\n01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:51,899\nYou need to concertina things\nrather than lay them out too leisurely.\n\n837\n01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,579\nSo you start to crush things together\nbecause the audience is up to speed\n\n838\n01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:01,659\nand can take those shorthand ways\nof crushing things together.\n\n839\n01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:07,969\n(Alex) This took 20 drafts before Danny could\npersuade me to have a kiss between them.\n\n840\n01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,499\n(Danny) Here's your British\ncountry house scene.\n\n841\n01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,939\nIronically, it's all filled with barbed\nwire, floodlights and barricades,\n\n842\n01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,849\nbut it's still the Jane\nAusten country house.\n\n843\n01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:29,699\nOriginally we wanted it to be\na very feminine Queen Anne type house.\n\n844\n01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:34,499\nThis house was actually\nbuilt for Lord Nelson,\n\n845\n01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:39,899\nalthough he never got to live in it\nbecause he got killed at Trafalgar.\n\n846\n01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:44,779\nI think his brother took it on instead but it\nwas built for him, I think, by the country.\n\n847\n01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:49,690\nIt was given to him.\nHe's buried in the grounds, down the road.\n\n848\n01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,739\nWe wanted it to feel slightly feminine\n\n849\n01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:57,019\nbecause of the gender stuff that starts\nto come up in the film from now on.\n\n850\n01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,979\nWe wanted it to feel a\nslightly feminine place.\n\n851\n01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,699\n(Alex) That's Eccleston ruffling his hair,\nwhich he's just picking up.\n\n852\n01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,259\nThat's just him doing that.\n\n853\n01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:10,123\nIt reinforces the father thing.\n\n854\n01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,562\nMore exposition.\n\n855\n01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,419\nIt feels a bit more natural here.\n\n856\n01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,779\nThis was another shot that Danny set up\n\n857\n01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:30,202\nso that we could change dialogue,\nput more in in ADR,\n\n858\n01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,579\nand add to what wasn't there\nin the script when we were shooting it.\n\n859\n01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:39,619\nThese are fantastic actors, all these guys.\nReally impressed with them.\n\n860\n01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:43,379\nThe problem is, in a film,\nit's very different to differentiate them.\n\n861\n01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:47,059\nYou tend to caricature them slightly.\n\n862\n01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:51,819\nSo we put Leo in a pinny,\nand stuff like that,\n\n863\n01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,419\nso that you've got a code the audience\ncan cling to to separate them.\n\n864\n01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:00,979\nThe guy you don't have any worries about\nhere is Mailer, who you know straight away.\n\n865\n01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,490\nYou'll always remember throughout the film.\n\n866\n01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:11,059\nThis scene changed and changed\nand changed in what was said.\n\n867\n01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:17,419\nI have to admit, I always felt\nit should be more theoretical\n\n868\n01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:25,219\nabout the intellectual pulse\nthat lays behind the idea of the film,\n\n869\n01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,139\nand rage, and our responsibility for rage.\n\n870\n01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:33,019\nThat kind of psychological sickness\nwe have with each other.\n\n871\n01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,419\nBut it always felt plonky.\nThat's the danger of that.\n\n872\n01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:44,579\nWe ended up with a much more\nmatter-of-fact scene, I suppose,\n\n873\n01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,219\nwhich is about\nthe progression of the narrative.\n\n874\n01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:51,579\nHe's experimenting on this guy to see how\nlong it will take him to starve to death.\n\n875\n01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:57,179\n(Alex) For what it's worth, this is the\nsecond very conscious nod towards Romero,\n\n876\n01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,459\nwith the third in the trilogy.\n\n877\n01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,579\nThe first nod was towards\nthe second of his Dead trilogy.\n\n878\n01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:07,099\nThis is in the third, with Bub,\nthe chained-up Infected\n\n879\n01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,419\nin the underground compound\nof Day of the Dead.\n\n880\n01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,419\nAlways a character,\nan idea, that seemed very strong.\n\n881\n01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:21,099\nI never know with that kind of thing if\nit's theft or what, but it's there, anyway.\n\n882\n01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,899\n(Danny) It's not if you acknowledge it,\nI don't think.\n\n883\n01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,001\n(Alex) Quick, I'm acknowledging it.\n\n884\n01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,607\nYou hope that people\nwho know those films will get that.\n\n885\n01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,179\nWhile we're on the subject of other films,\n\n886\n01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:49,339\nthis, I was personally thinking a lot\nabout the cut scene in Apocalypse Now,\n\n887\n01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:54,859\nthis surreal dinner party on a plantation.\n\n888\n01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,963\nA French Indochina plantation.\n\n889\n01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:06,219\nEver since watching Hearts of Darkness,\nthe documentary of the making of,\n\n890\n01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,979\nI hadn't really seen the scene\nproperly until Apocalypse Now Redux\n\n891\n01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,179\nbut I just loved the idea\nof a surreal dinner party,\n\n892\n01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:18,930\nhaving a dinner party here\nwith soldiers in dress uniform,\n\n893\n01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:24,179\nand trying to cling on\nto some notion of civilisation.\n\n894\n01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:30,419\n(Danny) And this Italian fresco\nbehind them. And eating...\n\n895\n01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,899\n(Alex) It was a much longer scene.\n\n896\n01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,259\nThis got messed around a lot.\n\n897\n01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:42,649\nObviously there's something problematic\nabout surreal dinner party scenes in films.\n\n898\n01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:47,047\n(Danny) I love the way Chris does\nthe bad omelette acting.\n\n899\n01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:54,419\nThese scenes are always a nightmare\nwhen you film them, dinner party scenes.\n\n900\n01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:59,979\nIt's all about left to right, right to left.\n\"Who's he looking at when he's looking that way?\"\n\n901\n01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,739\nThe truth is, no matter who you are,\n\n902\n01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:05,819\nyou end up going round the table,\nshooting everybody.\n\n903\n01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,699\nYou double up sometimes, to make sure\nthe editor's got enough in editing,\n\n904\n01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:15,281\nwhere the editor can control the pace\nof the scene and shape it a bit.\n\n905\n01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,499\nBut it's basically pretty bog standard.\n\n906\n01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,579\nYou just have to cover it, as any director'll\ntell you about dinner party scenes.\n\n907\n01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,019\nIt's an acting scene as well.\n\n908\n01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,339\nThe danger,\ncos you have to repeat it so much,\n\n909\n01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:31,539\nis that the actors get bored\nor lose their freshness with it.\n\n910\n01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:37,379\nBut Eccleston's fantastic\nat keeping control of the scene\n\n911\n01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,179\nand giving enough to other people\nso they've got enough to act with,\n\n912\n01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:45,930\nbut keeping enough back for his own takes.\n\n913\n01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:56,619\nThat's Stuart McQuarrie.\nHe's the American tourist in Trainspotting\n\n914\n01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:01,939\nwho was kicked and assaulted\nin the toilet in Trainspotting by Begbie.\n\n915\n01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:06,339\nHe's a wonderful actor. It was great to get\nhim for this, to have this other presence,\n\n916\n01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:11,648\nthis different view, really,\nwhich you get to hear a bit more of later.\n\n917\n01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:19,486\n(Alex) I think he's got\nthe hardest lines in the film to say,\n\n918\n01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:24,619\nclunkiest written, and I think\nhe copes with them extraordinarily well.\n\n919\n01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,659\n(Danny) But I like that, cos it stops dead.\n\n920\n01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:31,739\nIt's like a big lead weight's dropped\non the table, of something different.\n\n921\n01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,499\nSo I think that's good.\n\n922\n01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:38,922\n(Alex) But if you'd given it to another\nactor, it would have been a car wreck.\n\n923\n01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:45,259\n(Danny) I love this moment where\nChris acknowledges that she's right there,\n\n924\n01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,291\nbefore madness takes over again.\n\n925\n01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:54,459\nThere's the pinny again, just so you know.\nLittle clues like that.\n\n926\n01:13:54,460 --> 01:14:01,406\n(Alex) They're all in uniform, and uniforms\nare designed to remove different characters.\n\n927\n01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,459\n<i>(Danny) That's right.</i>\n\n928\n01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:09,724\nYou rarely remember character names\nanyway, beyond the hero and the heroine.\n\n929\n01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:22,459\nThere's me running across the foreground,\ntrying to make up the numbers.\n\n930\n01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,659\nWe didn't quite have\nenough people to do it with.\n\n931\n01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:31,899\nActually, the numbers were increased\na bit by the digital house, Clear, again.\n\n932\n01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,921\nDoubling up people.\n\n933\n01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,801\n- (Alex) Cold night.\n- (Danny) Yeah.\n\n934\n01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,939\n- (Alex) This is the bounce.\n- (Danny) Oh, yes. The double whammy.\n\n935\n01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,419\nI don't know whether people get that.\n\n936\n01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:57,219\nI don't know whether\nthey hear him say \"He bounced.\"\n\n937\n01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:01,402\nAnyway, he does.\nThat he'd never seen that before.\n\n938\n01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:16,847\nSo they come in. They're obviously\nfired up by that slaughter, really.\n\n939\n01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:24,131\nThe film from then on begins to take on\na very different complexion in terms off...\n\n940\n01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,899\nGenders are revealed, really, if you like.\n\n941\n01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,099\nIt's inevitable that\nthey start to come out.\n\n942\n01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:37,441\nAt first jokingly like this,\nbut then on a serious level as well.\n\n943\n01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,859\n(Alex) There's a good example\ncoming up of what you can do in ADR\n\n944\n01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:52,339\nwith Chris Eccleston\nsaying \"Slow down\" to his men,\n\n945\n01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:58,339\nwhich says that he's complicit\nand understanding in what's happening.\n\n946\n01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,099\n(Danny) But not the way\nthey're going about it just now.\n\n947\n01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:06,259\n- It's a line he says to...\n- (Alex) Clifton.\n\n948\n01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:12,569\n(Danny) \"Slow down\", which is added in ADR cos\nhe was in shadow, but it works brilliantly.\n\n949\n01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:17,979\nAgain, there's the standoff between those\ntwo, the two alternative authority figures.\n\n950\n01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,648\nOr the two world views.\n\n951\n01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:29,339\nIt was also meant to be linked to a special\naffection he had for that soldier.\n\n952\n01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,179\nThis guy takes his hat off\nwhen he's in the dining room.\n\n953\n01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,259\nWe eventually cut it.\nHe had to kill that man himself.\n\n954\n01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:39,619\nYou'll see it in the deleted scenes. The\ntwo of them play it beautifully together.\n\n955\n01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:44,539\nThere was a special bond between them but, for\nreasons I'll explain later, we had to cut it.\n\n956\n01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,847\n(Alex) This is two actors\nplaying beautifully together.\n\n957\n01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,779\n(Danny) This, I think, is a cracking scene.\n\n958\n01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,139\n(Alex) And it was in jeopardy at one point.\n\n959\n01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,179\nIt goes to show that\neverything's up for grabs.\n\n960\n01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:05,047\nBut it's pivotal in terms of plot.\n\n961\n01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:09,899\nIt makes me surprised\nthat we even discussed dropping it now.\n\n962\n01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,939\n(Danny) I think you just\ngo into a kind of...\n\n963\n01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:17,099\nYou challenge almost anything\nand sometimes that's not a good thing.\n\n964\n01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,259\nBut I guess sometimes it is.\n\n965\n01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,139\nI loved it when Alex brought it in\n\n966\n01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:27,019\nand it obviously developed the idea of\nwhat had happened with him killing the kid.\n\n967\n01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:33,019\n(Alex) It actually came out of an argument\nwith Chris Eccleston and Cillian Murphy.\n\n968\n01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:38,579\nThey said that the scene that existed before\nwasn't good enough, and they were right.\n\n969\n01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:44,446\nI remember we wrote this\nthe day before it was shot,\n\n970\n01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,610\nthat night, in the hotel\nroom up in Salisbury.\n\n971\n01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:56,059\nIt was reverting to an earlier scene.\n\n972\n01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:00,099\nThere was a scene that could have been\nshot here that would have been terrible,\n\n973\n01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:04,099\nbut Chris Eccleston\nand Cillian mutinied - correctly.\n\n974\n01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:10,204\n(Danny) The way they play it, there's\nsomething almost homoerotic between them.\n\n975\n01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:15,521\nCan Cillian break that bond,\nreally, which is being...\n\n976\n01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:23,841\n(Alex) Not least because he talks\nabout sex in terms of procreation\n\n977\n01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,362\nrather than recreation.\n\n978\n01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:38,088\n(Danny) Cillian takes a good hit here.\nHe does that very well.\n\n979\n01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:03,046\nThis is Cillian's last chance to join.\n\n980\n01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:09,563\nThis is for all the things\nto be said or left unsaid between them.\n\n981\n01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:25,499\nThen we move into the cellar\nwhere you hear the sergeant\n\n982\n01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:30,779\ntalking about the fact that\nit's not a worldwide contagion,\n\n983\n01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:37,339\nthat it has been contained and that so-called\nnormal life is going on elsewhere.\n\n984\n01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,419\nThis was something that developed\nas we did the film.\n\n985\n01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:45,523\nWe came up with this idea of quarantine.\n\n986\n01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:54,019\nWhat was great about it is that we set out\nto say it was a worldwide contagion.\n\n987\n01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,499\nWe were gonna shoot\nsome scenes at one point\n\n988\n01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,739\nof infection getting on a plane to America.\n\n989\n01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:02,539\nSo it was spreading worldwide\nacross seas and oceans.\n\n990\n01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:08,499\nThen, as we worked on the film, we decided to\nmake it that Britain would be quarantined.\n\n991\n01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:13,499\nIt gave hope that there might be\nsome way out of this.\n\n992\n01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:18,179\nAlso, it's curiously appropriate\nbecause when we were making the film\n\n993\n01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,579\nfoot and mouth had\nvery recently paralysed Britain.\n\n994\n01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:27,539\n(Alex) There was this concept of Britain\nbeing diseased with BSE and foot-and-mouth.\n\n995\n01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:31,419\nEvery time you turned around,\nit felt like there was something else.\n\n996\n01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:34,859\nOf course,\nthat also affects people within Britain.\n\n997\n01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:39,819\nIt's not just how other people perceive\nyou, it's how you perceive yourself.\n\n998\n01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:45,579\nThat was a hell of a bit of ADR\nbecause Stuart had to time it\n\n999\n01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:49,099\nso that when the camera came on to him,\nhe was saying the right words.\n\n1000\n01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,804\nThat was a real bit of professionalism.\n\n1001\n01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:04,579\n(Danny) That scene was shot\nby a different cameraman\n\n1002\n01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,939\ncos Anthony wasn't available\nto do our pick-ups,\n\n1003\n01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,259\nand we did that as a pick-up later.\n\n1004\n01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,339\nA kind of reshoot, really.\n\n1005\n01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:16,739\nIt was shot by this cameraman,\nAlwin Kuchler, who was very generous.\n\n1006\n01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,459\nHe stepped in cos Anthony wasn't available\n\n1007\n01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:25,019\nand shot that and a number of\nother sequences that you'll see,\n\n1008\n01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,459\nespecially towards the end of the film.\n\n1009\n01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:32,979\n(Alex) I love the way this looks.

I staged the scene.\n\n1109\n01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:16,779\nI had them sat there and I said \"I want them in\nfront of that beautiful picture of the woman,\n\n1110\n01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:21,099\nthe elegant woman, the portrait.\"\n\n1111\n01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:25,619\nI wanted the soldiers here like that,\nthen Anthony said \"We'll track.\"\n\n1112\n01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:30,699\nHe used this huge track,\nwhich you'll see used a couple of times.\n\n1113\n01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,659\nAlex'll like this\nbecause he can use this word \"track\".\n\n1114\n01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:37,139\nI'll say \"There, that's\nwhere it's tracking!\"\n\n1115\n01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:40,819\nIt gives a tremendous dynamic to the scene.\n\n1116\n01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:44,059\nWe've used it once already\nand you'll see it coming up again.\n\n1117\n01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:47,619\nIt binds together\nthe different elements of the room.\n\n1118\n01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,699\nCameramen are wonderful at that.\n\n1119\n01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,739\nSometimes you think of them as directors,\nbut not in the way the cameraman does.\n\n1120\n01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:57,499\nIt's cos they're always looking\nthrough the camera. That's their job.\n\n1121\n01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:02,059\nThey feel it. They suddenly have a feeling\nfor a scene, that it needs to be like this.\n\n1122\n01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,570\nYou'll see when he crosses back now.\n\n1123\n01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:12,099\nIt keeps them all connected in the room.\nIt's all round a pivot. I love that.\n\n1124\n01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:15,979\nWith a sequence like that, you've got\nto basically direct the shit out of it,\n\n1125\n01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:19,379\nwhich is what I tried to do\nwith this end sequence.\n\n1126\n01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,259\nWe spent a lot of time and money on it,\n\n1127\n01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:29,605\nso that you'd have something\nto get excited about, really, I guess.\n\n1128\n01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,459\nThis is horrible for the guy underneath.\n\n1129\n01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:45,539\nIt's actually coming out of a pipe\nat the side of his mouth.\n\n1130\n01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:48,819\nIt's just being pumped through.\nIt's very pleasant.\n\n1131\n01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:52,579\nRed Ovaltine or something.\nIt's something very pleasant, anyway.\n\n1132\n01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,299\nAlthough the whole idea of this\nisn't very nice at all.\n\n1133\n01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:00,299\n(Alex) This was a sort of gag,\nthis shot coming up.\n\n1134\n01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,004\nThis left-to-right, like a tennis match.\n\n1135\n01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:10,859\nIt's risky because if people laugh,\ndoes that destroy the tension?\n\n1136\n01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:15,326\nAnd if they don't laugh,\nhave you failed to provide a gag?\n\n1137\n01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,486\nThis had some cuts in\nit on grounds of taste.\n\n1138\n01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:28,739\nThis death of...
