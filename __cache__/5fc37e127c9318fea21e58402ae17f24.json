00:30:39,353\nI tried to stop him but he was too fast.\n\n365\n00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:40,783\nHe has no memories, then?\n\n366\n00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:41,972\nOnly fragments.\n\n367\n00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,282\nThe procedure, it was interrupted.\n\n368\n00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:47,325\nI guess it's only a matter\nof rounding him up.\n\n369\n00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,472\nYou have had strays before, right?\n\n370\n00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,428\nThis is no stray, Doctor.\n\n371\n00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:53,792\nThis one can tune.\n\n372\n00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:54,918\nBut that's impossible.\n\n373\n00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,490\nI thought only you had that ability.\n\n374\n00:30:56,492 --> 00:31:00,593\nYou will process another template\nof the subject's memories, yes?\n\n375\n00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,600\nOf course.\nI'll imprint him again.\n\n376\n00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,570\nNo.\n\n377\n00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,151\nWe require them for a quite\ndifferent purpose.\n\n378\n00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,326\nIt's almost midnight, Dr. Schreber.\n\n379\n00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,849\nWe'll talk again after tonight's tuning, but...\n\n380\n00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:15,056\nno more delays, yes?\n\n381\n00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,704\nNo more...\n\n382\n00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,217\ninconsistencies in your behavior.\n\n383\n00:31:27,728 --> 00:31:29,638\nYou appear quite frail, Doctor.\n\n384\n00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:33,946\nPerhaps some exercise\nwould do you good.\n\n385\n00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:49,855\nCome in.\nKate.\n\n386\n00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,382\nHow is he?\n\n387\n00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:56,618\nThe same.\n\n388\n00:31:57,681 --> 00:31:58,748\nWalenski?\n\n389\n00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,276\nIt's me, Frank.\n\n390\n00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:07,662\nCome in, Frank.\n\n391\n00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:12,119\nClose the door.\n\n392\n00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:23,214\nI've been looking through\nsome of your old reports.\n\n393\n00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:25,910\nIt's an interesting case.\n\n394\n00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:30,111\nThe kind that can make a man's career...\n\n395\n00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:32,799\nor break it.\n\n396\n00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:35,135\nYeah, I was on that case.\n\n397\n00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,029\nAnd then what?\n\n398\n00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:39,407\nWhat happened then, Eddie?\n\n399\n00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,000\nNothing happened, Frank.\n\n400\n00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,075\nI've just been spending\ntime on the subway,\n\n401\n00:32:44,306 --> 00:32:45,735\nriding in circles.\n\n402\n00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:47,646\nThinking in circles.\n\n403\n00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,782\nThere's no way out.\n\n404\n00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,548\nI've been over every inch of this city.\n\n405\n00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,354\nYou're scaring your wife\nto death, Eddie.\n\n406\n00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,690\nShe's not my wife.\n\n407\n00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:04,948\nI don't know who she is.\n\n408\n00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:06,624\nI don't know who any of us are.\n\n409\n00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:08,385\nWhat makes you say that?\n\n410\n00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:10,453\nDo you think about\nthe past much, Frank?\n\n411\n00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:13,747\nAs much as the next guy.\n\n412\n00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:17,095\nSee, I've been trying\nto remember things...\n\n413\n00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:19,938\nclearly remember things from my past.\n\n414\n00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:22,605\nBut the more I try to think back,\n\n415\n00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:25,095\nthe more it all starts to unravel.\n\n416\n00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:26,980\nNone of it seems real.\n\n417\n00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,745\nIt's like I've just been\ndreaming this life...\n\n418\n00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,868\nand when I finally wake up\nI'll be somebody else.\n\n419\n00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:36,429\nSomebody totally different.\n\n420\n00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:43,028\nYou saw something,\ndidn't you, Eddie?\n\n421\n00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:46,480\nSomething to do with the case.\n\n422\n00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:48,586\nThere is no case.\n\n423\n00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:50,145\nThere never was!\n\n424\n00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:52,744\nIt's all just a big joke!\n\n425\n00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:54,372\nIt's a joke!\n\n426\n00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,968\nTonight's

cards.\n\n433\n00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,151\nThese do bring back memories.\n\n434\n00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,768\nThis one is still warm.\n\n435\n00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,599\nWhat is it?\n\n436\n00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:03,658\nThe recollections of a great lover?\n\n437\n00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:06,489\nA catalog of conquests?\n\n438\n00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:08,723\nWe will soon find out.\n\n439\n00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,616\nYou would not appreciate that,\n\n440\n00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:13,954\nwould you, Mr. Whatever your name is?\n\n441\n00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,377\nNot the sort of conquests,\n\n442\n00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,685\nyou would ever understand.\n\n443\n00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,027\nLet's see.\n\n444\n00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:24,882\nA touch of unhappy childhood.\n\n445\n00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:33,124\nA dash of teenage rebellion.\n\n446\n00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:37,317\nAnd last, but not least...\n\n447\n00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,413\na tragic death in the family.\n\n448\n00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:41,403\nDoctor.\n\n449\n00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:44,966\nMr. Book.\n\n450\n00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:55,829\nWhy does Murdoch not sleep\nduring the tuning as the others do?\n\n451\n00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,734\nI don't know.\n\n452\n00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,000\nMaybe he's a step up\nthe evolutionary ladder.\n\n453\n00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,903\nA freak of nature.\nHe's adapting to survive.\n\n454\n00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,272\nWhat do you expect?\n\n455\n00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:06,250\nWeren't you looking\nfor the human soul?\n\n456\n00:36:06,340

00:36:15,072\nMaybe you have finally found\nwhat you are looking for,\n\n459\n00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:16,769\nand it's going to bite you on your...\n\n460\n00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:24,104\nIt requires several of your lifetimes\nto master our gifts.\n\n461\n00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:28,195\nThe idea that a simple man\ncould develop the ability to tune.\n\n462\n00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:29,591\nIs absurd, I know.\n\n463\n00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:31,838\nBut what other explanation is there?\n\n464\n00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,841\nIt is time.\n\n465\n00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,155\nShut it

looking after these kids,\nfor a change.\n\n472\n00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:03,699\nAnyways,\n\n473\n00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,986\nFrederickson says he'll take\nme off the damn night shift soon.\n\n474\n00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,372\nWell, it's about time, dear.\n\n475\n00:39:25,207 --> 00:39:26,196\nHello?\n\n476\n00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:29,817\nHello?\n\n477\n00:39:34,416 -->

they swap them around\nbetween us.\n\n644\n00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:43,362\nI've seen them do it.\nBack and forth, back and forth...\n\n645\n00:54:43,494 --> 00:54:45,730\ntill no one knows who they are

good, Mr. Hand.\n\n661\n00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:33,184\nBut we require a more practical link\nto his present whereabouts.\n\n662\n00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:36,827\nYes.\n\n663\n00:55:38,095 -->

--> 00:55:56,858\nTo be able to revisit those places\nwhich have meant so very much to us.\n\n667\n00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,767\nI thought it was more\nthat we were haunted by them.\n\n668\n00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:01,064\nPerhaps.\n\n669\n00:56:03,415 --> 00:56:04,805\nBut imagine a life...\n\n670\n00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:07,120\nalien to yours...\n\n671\n00:56:08,182 -->

would be a comfort.\n\n676\n00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:30,958\nBut if you were to discover\nsomething different.\n\n677\n00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:33,394\nSomething,\n\n678\n00:56:34,170 -->
