Barnes.\n\n1375\n01:24:51,248 --> 01:24:54,450\nI have come\nto a dark realization\n\n1376\n01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,686\nthat we exist inside\na simulation so advanced\n\n1377\n01:24:57,786 --> 01:25:00,556\nthat we cannot tell the\ndifference between real life\n\n1378\n01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:02,758\nand artificial dream.\n\n1379\n01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:07,696\nYou heard the Prophet.\nShe said, \"It is not real.\"\n\n1380\n01:25:07,797 --> 01:25:10,633\nYou see, fire dynamics\nare very difficult to render.\n\n1381\n01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:13,336\nI've noticed this anomaly\nin its behavior\n\n1382\n01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:15,537\nwhen it interacts\nwith simulated NPCs,\n\n1383\n01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:18,641\nlike poor old Sister B.\n\n1384\n01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:22,379\nShe

maybe?\n\n1390\n01:25:35,892 --> 01:25:36,960\nUm...\n\n1391\n01:25:39,863 --> 01:25:41,430\nThat's a theory.\n\n1392\n01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:44,667\nWell yeah,\nyou're very welcome to...\n\n1393\n01:25:45,768 --> 01:25:47,469\nto challenge my premise.\nI love that.\n\n1394\n01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:50,907\nGo for it.\n\n1395\n01:25:55,678 --> 01:25:58,815\nI don't think\nthis is a microchip.\n\n1396\n01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:00,516\nOh?\n\n1397\n01:26:00,616 --> 01:26:03,585\nI think it's a contraceptive.\n\n1398\n01:26:05,487 --> 01:26:08,624\nA... a birth control

01:26:27,811\nfeel ashamed about it,\n\n1405\n01:26:27,911 --> 01:26:29,645\nand she would've been\ntoo embarrassed.\n\n1406\n01:26:30,646 --> 01:26:32,449\n-Simulation theory

01:26:41,690\nis not testable, is it?\n\n1410\n01:26:42,959 --> 01:26:46,329\nNo, it's a matter of belief,\nlike any religion.\n\n1411\n01:26:46,429 --> 01:26:48,697\nYou either believe it,\ngreen door,\n\n1412\n01:26:48,798 --> 01:26:50,632\nor you don't believe it,\npurple door.\n\n1413\n01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:54,237\nWith all due respect,\n\n1414\n01:26:55,472 --> 01:26:56,638\nI...\n\n1415\n01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,109\nI don't believe it.\n\n1416\n01:26:59,876 --> 01:27:03,746\nI'm not smart enough\nto say why, I just don't.\n\n1417\n01:27:03,847 --> 01:27:06,149\nDo you believe the miracle\nthat I showed you?\n\n1418\n01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:07,750\nYes.\n\n1419\n01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:09,618\n-Yeah?\n-At first.\n\n1420\n01:27:11,321 --> 01:27:12,621\nBut now?\n\n1421\n01:27:12,721 --> 01:27:15,191\nI think something\nhappened tonight\n\n1422\n01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,327\nthat you didn't expect.\n\n1423\n01:27:17,427 --> 01:27:19,029\nIt feels like\nyou're improvising,\n\n1424\n01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:21,630\ntrying to convince me\nof a simulation theory\n\n1425\n01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,867\nthat's not sticking.\nAm I right?\n\n1426\n01:27:26,769 --> 01:27:30,040\nUh, are you\nasking me if you're right\n\n1427\n01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,107\nthat I am improvising\n\n1428\n01:27:31,207 --> 01:27:34,576\nor you're right\nthat the simulation narrative\n\n1429\n01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:35,611\nis not sticking?\n\n1430\n01:27:35,711 --> 01:27:38,148\nYes.\n\n1431\n01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,185\nHigh-five.\n\n1432\n01:27:45,522 --> 01:27:46,990\nSo, in fact,\nyou agree with your friend.\n\n1433\n01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:49,526\nYou think that the Prophet\nwas just hallucinating\n\n1434\n01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:51,760\na meaningless,\nnear-death experience.\n\n1435\n01:27:52,362 --> 01:27:53,496\nNo.\n\n1436\n01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:56,266\nI think you switched\nthe bodies.\n\n1437\n01:27:58,567 --> 01:28:00,904\nI just haven't\nfigured out how yet.\n\n1438\n01:28:02,704 --> 01:28:03,907\nI switched...\n\n1439\n01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:05,809\nthe bodies?\n\n1440\n01:28:11,181 --> 01:28:14,050\nThe doorbell rang\nwhen the Elder got here.\n\n1441\n01:28:17,187 --> 01:28:19,089\n<i>Which drew our attention</i>\n<i>to the stairs.</i>\n\n1442\n01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:21,790\n<i>You would have been</i>\n<i>prepared for that.</i>\n\n1443\n01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:25,761\nWhen we came back downstairs,\n\n1444\n01:28:25,862 --> 01:28:29,499\nI noticed the woman wasn't in\nthe same position as before.\n\n1445\n01:28:29,598 --> 01:28:31,367\nIt was similar...\n\n1446\n01:28:31,468 --> 01:28:32,402\n<i>Her head is different.</i>\n\n1447\n01:28:32,502 --> 01:28:35,671\n<i>But it was not the exact same.</i>\n\n1448\n01:28:35,771 --> 01:28:39,342\n<i>I think another woman</i>\n<i>who looked exactly like her</i>\n\n1449\n01:28:39,442 --> 01:28:40,609\n<i>came into the basement</i>\n\n1450\n01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:42,912\n<i>through a hidden door</i>\n<i>or something,</i>\n\n1451\n01:28:43,012 -->

downstairs,\n\n1454\n01:28:50,652 --> 01:28:54,824\n<i>she read off</i>\n<i>a scripted prophecy</i>\n\n1455\n01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:57,026\n<i>that you prepared for her.</i>\n\n1456\n01:28:57,994 --> 01:29:01,763\n<i>Except the last thing</i>\n<i>she said was,</i>\n\n1457\n01:29:01,865 --> 01:29:03,166\n<i>\"It is not real.\"</i>\n\n1458\n01:29:03,266 --> 01:29:05,802\n...not... real...\n\n1459\n01:29:05,902 --> 01:29:08,538\nMaybe she was trying\nto tell us\n\n1460\n01:29:08,637 --> 01:29:11,040\nthat the miracle wasn't real.\n\n1461\n01:29:12,909 --> 01:29:13,877\nAh.\n\n1462\n01:29:15,111 --> 01:29:16,745\nYou see what I mean when I say\n\n1463\n01:29:16,846 --> 01:29:19,182\nsomething happened\nthat you didn't expect?\n\n1464\n01:29:19,282 --> 01:29:22,619\nI think you gave her a script,\nand she went off the book,\n\n1465\n01:29:22,718 --> 01:29:24,354\nand now you're\ntrying to recover.\n\n1466\n01:29:26,523 --> 01:29:28,324\nWell, if that's right,\nthen, uh,\n\n1467\n01:29:29,592 --> 01:29:32,195\nthere'd have to be another way\ninto this basement, yeah?\n\n1468\n01:29:33,296 --> 01:29:34,330\nShall we have a look?\n\n1469\n01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:43,039\nI don't think there is.\n\n1470\n01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,074\nNo.\n\n1471\n01:29:45,508 --> 01:29:47,310\nI'm not doing very well,\n\n1472\n01:29:47,410

to be\na dead body down there\n\n1476\n01:30:54,877 --> 01:30:56,512\nif you were right, huh?\n\n1477\n01:30:56,613 --> 01:30:57,981\nCorrect.\n\n1478\n01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:00,083\nHow will
