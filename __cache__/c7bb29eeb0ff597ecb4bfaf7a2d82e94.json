--> 00:47:59,295\nI figured a way out.\n\n480\n00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:12,017\nThey were here.\n\n481\n00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,520\nLast night.\n\n482\n00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:17,772\nThis was to be his home.\n\n483\n00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,235\nThat was when we loved her.\n\n484\n00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:24,612\nThis is all well and good,\n\n485\n00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:26,656\nbut we require\na more practical link...\n\n486\n00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,742\nto his present whereabouts.\n\n487\n00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:35,457\nAnd I know where to find her.\n\n488\n00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,177\nWe're very lucky,\nwhen you think about it.\n\n489\n00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:48,219\nI'm sorry?\n\n490\n00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:50,347\nTo be able to revisit\nthose places...\n\n491\n00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,349\nwhich meant\nso very much to us.\n\n492\n00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,727\nI thought we were haunted\nby them.\n\n493\n00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,520\nPerhaps.\n\n494\n00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,023\nThere used to be a ferry\nwhen I was a boy.\n\n495\n00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,150\nBiggest thing you ever saw.\n\n496\n00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:05,028\nLit up like\na floating birthday cake.\n\n497\n00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,948\nThat's just what my husband\nonce said to me.\n\n498\n00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,533\nOn this very spot.\n\n499\n00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,120\nWhere is your husband now?\n\n500\n00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,999\nI wish I knew.\nWhat brings you here?\n\n501\n00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:20,877\nI met my wife at this place.\n\n502\n00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:23,171\nIt's where I met my husband.\n\n503\n00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:24,714\nSmall world.\n\n504\n00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:19,894\nHello?\n\n505\n00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:09,110\nWhat are you doing here?\n\n506\n00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,779\nI've been following you.\n"}
